\section{Higher order derivatives}{}{}

In single variable calculus we saw that the second derivative is often
useful: in appropriate circumstances it measures acceleration; it can
be used to identify maximum and minimum points; it tells us something
about how sharply curved a graph is. Not surprisingly, second
derivatives are also useful in the multi-variable case, but again not
surprisingly, things are a bit more complicated.

It's easy to see where some complication is going to come from: with
two variables there are four possible second derivatives. To take a
``derivative,'' we must take a partial derivative with respect to $x$
or $y$, and there are four ways to do it: $x$ then $x$, $x$ then $y$, 
$y$ then $x$, $y$ then $y$.

\example Compute all four second derivatives of $f(x,y)=x^2y^2$.

Using an obvious notation, we get:
$$f_{xx}=2y^2\qquad f_{xy}=4xy\qquad f_{yx}=4xy\qquad f_{yy}=2x^2.$$

You will have noticed that two of these are the same, the ``mixed
partials'' computed by taking partial derivatives with respect to both
variables in the two possible orders. This is not an accident---as
long as the function is reasonably nice, this will always be true.

\thm (Clairaut's Theorem) If the mixed partial derivatives are
continuous, they are equal.

\example Compute the mixed partials of $\ds f=xy/(x^2+y^2)$.
$$
f_x={y^3-x^2y\over(x^2+y^2)^2}\qquad
f_{xy}=-{x^4-6x^2y^2+y^4\over (x^2+y^2)^3}
$$
We leave $f_{yx}$ as an exercise.
