\section{The Derivative of $\sin x$}{}{The Derivative of the sine}
\nobreak
What about the derivative of the sine function? The rules for
derivatives that we have are no help, since $\sin x$ is not an
algebraic function. We need to return to the definition of the
derivative, set up a limit, and try to compute it. Here's the
definition:
$${d\over dx}\sin x = \lim_{\Delta x\to0} {\sin(x+\Delta x)-\sin x
  \over \Delta x}.$$
Using some trigonometric identities, we can make a little progress on
  the quotient:
$$\eqalign{
{\sin(x+\Delta x)-\sin x
  \over \Delta x}&={\sin x \cos \Delta x + \sin \Delta x \cos x - \sin
  x\over \Delta x}\cr
&=\sin x{\cos \Delta x - 1\over \Delta x}+\cos x{\sin\Delta x\over
  \Delta x}.\cr
}$$

\noindent
This isolates the difficult bits in the two limits
$$\lim_{\Delta x\to0}{\cos \Delta x - 1\over \Delta x}\quad\hbox{and}\quad
 \lim_{\Delta x\to0} {\sin\Delta x\over \Delta x}.$$
Here we get a little lucky: it turns out that once we know the second
 limit the first is quite easy. The second is quite tricky,
 however. Indeed, it is the hardest limit we will actually compute,
 and we devote a section to it.
