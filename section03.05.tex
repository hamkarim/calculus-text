\section{The Chain Rule}{}{}
\index{chain rule}

So far we have seen how to compute the derivative of a function built
up from other functions by addition, subtraction, multiplication and
division. There is another very important way that we combine simple
functions to make more complicated functions: function
composition\index{composition of functions}, as discussed in
section~\xrefn{sec:limits}. For example, consider $\ds
\sqrt{625-x^2}$. This function has many simpler components, like 625
and $\ds x^2$, and then there is that square root symbol, so the
square root function $\ds \sqrt{x}=x^{1/2}$ is involved. The obvious
question is: can we compute the derivative using the derivatives of
the constituents $\ds 625-x^2$ and $\ds \sqrt{x}$? We can indeed. In
general, if $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ are functions, we can compute the
derivatives of $f(g(x))$ and $g(f(x))$ in terms of $f'(x)$ and
$g'(x)$. 

\example Form the two possible compositions of $\ds f(x)=\sqrt{x}$ and
$\ds g(x)=625-x^2$ and compute the derivatives.  First, $\ds
f(g(x))=\sqrt{625-x^2}$, and the derivative is $\ds -x/\sqrt{625-x^2}$
as we have seen. Second, $\ds g(f(x))=625-(\sqrt{x})^2=625-x$ with
derivative $-1$. Of course, these calculations do not use anything
new, and in particular the derivative of $f(g(x))$ was somewhat
tedious to compute from the definition.
\endexample

Suppose we want the derivative of $f(g(x))$.
Again, let's set up the derivative and play some algebraic tricks:
$$\eqalign{
{d\over dx}f(g(x))
&=\lim_{\Delta x\to0} {f(g(x+\Delta x))-f(g(x))\over\Delta x}\cr
&=\lim_{\Delta x\to0} {f(g(x+\Delta x))-f(g(x))\over g(x+\Delta
  x))-g(x)} {g(x+\Delta x))-g(x)\over\Delta x}\cr
}$$
Now we see immediately that the second fraction turns into $g'(x)$
when we take the limit. The first fraction is more complicated, but it
too looks something like a derivative. The denominator, $g(x+\Delta
x))-g(x)$, is a change in the value of $g$, so let's abbreviate
it as $\Delta g=g(x+\Delta
x))-g(x)$, which also means $g(x+\Delta x)=g(x)+\Delta g$. This gives
us
$$\lim_{\Delta x\to0} {f(g(x)+\Delta g)-f(g(x))\over \Delta g}.$$
As $\Delta x$ goes to 0, it is also true that $\Delta g$ goes to 0,
because $g(x+\Delta x)$ goes to $g(x)$. So we can rewrite this limit
as
$$\lim_{\Delta g\to0} {f(g(x)+\Delta g)-f(g(x))\over \Delta g}.$$
Now this looks exactly like a derivative, namely $f'(g(x))$, that is,
the function $f'(x)$ with $x$ replaced by $g(x)$. If this all
withstands scrutiny, we then get
$${d\over dx}f(g(x))=f'(g(x))g'(x).$$
Unfortunately, there is a small flaw in the argument. Recall that what
we mean by $\lim_{\Delta x\to0}$ involves what happens when $\Delta x$
is close to 0 {\em but not equal to 0.} The qualification is very
important, since we must be able to divide by $\Delta x$.
But when $\Delta x$ is close to 0 but not equal to 0,
$\Delta g=g(x+\Delta
x))-g(x)$ is close to 0 {\em and possibly equal to 0.} This means it
doesn't really make sense to divide by $\Delta g$.
Fortunately, it is possible to recast the argument to avoid this
difficulty, but it is a bit tricky; we will not include the details,
which can be found in many calculus books. Note that many functions
$g$ do have the property that $g(x+\Delta x)-g(x)\not=0$ when $\Delta
x$ is small, and for these functions the argument above is fine.

The chain rule has a particularly simple expression if we use the
Leibniz notation for the derivative. The quantity $f'(g(x))$ is the
derivative of $f$ with $x$ replaced by $g$; this can be written 
$df/dg$. As usual, $g'(x)=dg/dx$. Then the chain rule becomes
$${df\over dx} = {df\over dg}{dg\over dx}.$$
This looks like trivial arithmetic, but it is not: $dg/dx$ is not a
fraction, that is, not literal division, but a single symbol that
means $g'(x)$. Nevertheless, it turns out that what looks like trivial
arithmetic, and is therefore easy to remember, is really true.

It will take a bit of practice to make the use of the chain rule come
naturally---it is more complicated than the earlier differentiation
rules we have seen.

\example
Compute the derivative of $\ds \sqrt{625-x^2}$. We already know that the
answer is $\ds -x/\sqrt{625-x^2}$, computed directly from the limit. In
the context of the chain rule, we have $\ds f(x)=\sqrt{x}$,
$\ds g(x)=625-x^2$. We know that $\ds f'(x)=(1/2)x^{-1/2}$, so $\ds f'(g(x))=
(1/2)(625-x^2)^{-1/2}$. Note that this is a two step computation:
first compute $f'(x)$, then replace $x$ by $g(x)$. Since $g'(x)=-2x$
we have
$$f'(g(x))g'(x)={1\over 2\sqrt{625-x^2}}(-2x)={-x\over
    \sqrt{625-x^2}}.
$$

\example
Compute the derivative of $\ds 1/\sqrt{625-x^2}$. This is a quotient with
a constant numerator, so we could use the quotient rule, but it is
simpler to use the chain rule. The function is $\ds (625-x^2)^{-1/2}$, the
composition of $\ds f(x)=x^{-1/2}$ and $\ds g(x)=625-x^2$. We compute
$\ds f'(x)=(-1/2)x^{-3/2}$ using the power rule, and then
$$f'(g(x))g'(x)={-1\over 2(625-x^2)^{3/2}}(-2x)={x\over (625-x^2)^{3/2}}.
$$
\vskip-10pt
\endexample

In practice, of course, you will need to use more than one of the
rules we have developed to compute the derivative of a complicated
function.

\example
Compute the derivative of $$f(x)={x^2-1\over x\sqrt{x^2+1}}.$$
The ``last'' operation here is division, so to get started we need to
use the quotient rule first. This gives
$$
\eqalign{
f'(x)&={(x^2-1)'x\sqrt{x^2+1}-(x^2-1)(x\sqrt{x^2+1})'\over
x^2(x^2+1)}\cr
&={2x^2\sqrt{x^2+1}-(x^2-1)(x\sqrt{x^2+1})'\over
x^2(x^2+1)}.\cr
}$$
Now we need to compute the derivative of $\ds x\sqrt{x^2+1}$. This is a
product, so we use the product rule:
$${d\over dx}x\sqrt{x^2+1}=x{d\over dx}\sqrt{x^2+1}+\sqrt{x^2+1}.$$
Finally, we use the chain rule:
$${d\over dx}\sqrt{x^2+1}={d\over dx}(x^2+1)^{1/2}=
{1\over 2}(x^2+1)^{-1/2}(2x)={x\over \sqrt{x^2+1}}.$$
And putting it all together:
$$
\eqalign{
f'(x)&={2x^2\sqrt{x^2+1}-(x^2-1)(x\sqrt{x^2+1})'\over
x^2(x^2+1)}.\cr
&={2x^2\sqrt{x^2+1}-(x^2-1)\left(x{\ds{x\over \sqrt{x^2+1}}}
+\sqrt{x^2+1}\right)\over
x^2(x^2+1)}.\cr
}$$
This can be simplified of course, but we have done all the calculus,
so that only algebra is left.
\endexample

\example
Compute the derivative of $\ds \sqrt{1+\sqrt{1+\sqrt{x}}}$. Here we have a
more complicated chain of compositions, so we use the chain rule
twice.
At the outermost ``layer'' we have the function
$\ds g(x)=1+\sqrt{1+\sqrt{x}}$ plugged into $\ds f(x)=\sqrt{x}$, so applying
the chain rule once gives 
$${d\over dx}\sqrt{1+\sqrt{1+\sqrt{x}}}=
{1\over 2}\left(1+\sqrt{1+\sqrt{x}}\right)^{-1/2}{d\over dx}
\left(1+\sqrt{1+\sqrt{x}}\right).$$
Now we need the derivative of $\ds \sqrt{1+\sqrt{x}}$. Using the chain
rule again:
$${d\over dx}\sqrt{1+\sqrt{x}}={1\over
  2}\left(1+\sqrt{x}\right)^{-1/2}{1\over 2}x^{-1/2}.$$
So the original derivative is 
$$
\eqalign{
{d\over dx}\sqrt{1+\sqrt{1+\sqrt{x}}}&=
{1\over 2}\left(1+\sqrt{1+\sqrt{x}}\right)^{-1/2}
{1\over
  2}\left(1+\sqrt{x}\right)^{-1/2}{1\over 2}x^{-1/2}.\cr
&={1\over 8 \sqrt{x}\sqrt{1+\sqrt{x}}\sqrt{1+\sqrt{1+\sqrt{x}}}}
}$$
\vskip -16pt
\endexample

Using the chain rule, the power rule, and the product rule, it is
possible to avoid using the quotient rule entirely.

\example
Compute the derivative of $\ds f(x)={x^3\over x^2+1}$. Write 
$\ds f(x)=x^3(x^2+1)^{-1}$, then
$$
\eqalign{
f'(x)&=x^3{d\over dx}(x^2+1)^{-1}+3x^2(x^2+1)^{-1}\cr
&=x^3(-1)(x^2+1)^{-2}(2x)+3x^2(x^2+1)^{-1}\cr
&=-2x^4(x^2+1)^{-2}+3x^2(x^2+1)^{-1}\cr
&={-2x^4\over (x^2+1)^{2}}+{3x^2\over x^2+1}\cr
&={-2x^4\over (x^2+1)^{2}}+{3x^2(x^2+1)\over (x^2+1)^{2}}\cr
&={-2x^4+3x^4+3x^2\over (x^2+1)^{2}}={x^4+3x^2\over (x^2+1)^{2}}\cr
}$$
Note that we already had the derivative on the second line; all the
rest is simplification. It is easier to get to this answer by using
the quotient rule, so there's a trade off: more work for fewer
memorized formulas.
