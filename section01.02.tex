\section{Distance Between Two Points; Circles}{}{}

Given two points $(x_1,y_1)$ and $(x_2,y_2)$, recall that their
horizontal distance from one another is $\Delta x=x_2-x_1$ and their
vertical distance from one another is $\Delta y=y_2-y_1$.  (Actually,
the word ``distance'' normally denotes ``positive distance''. $\Delta
x$ and $\Delta y$ are {\it signed\/} distances, but this is clear from
context.)  The actual (positive) distance from one point to the other
is the length of the hypotenuse of a right triangle with legs $|\Delta
x|$ and $|\Delta y|$, as shown in figure~\xrefn{fig:distance between
points}.  The Pythagorean theorem then says that the distance between
the two points is the square root of the sum of the squares of the
horizontal and vertical sides:
$$
  \hbox{distance}
    =\sqrt{(\Delta x)^2+(\Delta y)^2}=\sqrt{(x_2-x_1)^2+ (y_2-y_1)^2}.
$$
For example, the distance between points $A(2,1)$ and $B(3,3)$ is
$\sqrt{(3-2)^2+(3-1)^2}=\sqrt{5}$.

As a special case of the distance formula, suppose we want to know the
distance of a point $(x,y)$ to the origin.  According to the distance
formula, this is $\sqrt{(x-0)^2+(y-0)^2}=\sqrt{x^2+y^2}$.

A point $(x,y)$ is at a distance $r$ from the origin if and only if
$\sqrt{x^2+y^2}=r$, or, if we square both sides: $x^2+y^2=r^2$.  This is
the equation of the circle\index{circle!equation of} 
of radius $r$ centered at the origin.
The special case $r=1$ is called the unit 
circle\index{unit circle}\index{circle!unit}; 
its equation is
$x^2+y^2=1$.

Similarly, if $C(h,k)$ is any fixed point, then a point $(x,y)$ is at a
distance $r$ from the point $C$ if and only if $\sqrt{(x-h)^2+(y-k)^2}=r$,
i.e., if and only if 
$$
(x-h)^2+(y-k)^2=r^2.
$$
This is the equation of the circle\index{circle!equation of} 
of radius $r$ centered at the
point $(h,k)$.  For example, the circle of radius 5 centered at the
point $(0,-6)$ has equation $(x-0)^2+(y--6)^2=25$, or
$x^2+(y+6)^2=25$.  If we
expand this we get $x^2+y^2+12y+36=25$ or 
$x^2+y^2+12y+11=0$, but the original form is usually more useful.

\example Graph the circle $x^2-2x+y^2+4y-11=0$. With a little thought
we convert this to $(x-1)^2+(y+2)^2-16=0$ or $(x-1)^2+(y+2)^2=16$.
Now we see that this is the circle with radius 4 and center $(1,-2)$,
which is easy to graph.
