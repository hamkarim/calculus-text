\section{Moment and Center of Mass}{}{}

Using a single integral we were able to compute the center of mass for
a one-dimensional object with variable density, and a two dimensional
object with constant density. With a double integral we can handle two
dimensions and variable density.

Just as before, the coordinates of the center of mass are
$$\bar x={M_y\over M} \qquad \bar y={M_x\over M},$$
where $M$ is the total mass, $M_y$ is the moment\index{moment}
 around the $y$-axis,
and $M_x$ is the moment around the $x$-axis. (You may want to review
the concepts in section~\xrefn{sec:center of mass}.) 

The key to the computation, just as before, is the approximation of
mass. In the two-dimensional case, we treat density $\sigma$ as mass
per square area, so when density is constant, mass is 
$(\hbox{density})(\hbox{area})$. If we have a two-dimensional region
with varying density given by $\sigma(x,y)$, and we divide the region
into small subregions with area $\Delta A$, then the mass of one
subregion is approximately $\sigma(x_i,y_j)\Delta A$, the total mass
is approximately the sum of many of these, 
and as usual the sum
turns into an integral in the limit:
$$M=\int_{x_0}^{x_1}\int_{y_0}^{y_1} \sigma(x,y)\,dy\,dx,$$
and similarly for computations in cylindrical coordinates.
Then as before
$$\eqalign{
M_x &= \int_{x_0}^{x_1}\int_{y_0}^{y_1} y\sigma(x,y)\,dy\,dx\cr
M_y &= \int_{x_0}^{x_1}\int_{y_0}^{y_1} x\sigma(x,y)\,dy\,dx.\cr
}$$

\example Find the center of mass of a thin, uniform plate whose shape
is the region between $y=\cos x$ and the $x$-axis between $x=-\pi/2$
and $x=\pi/2$. Since the density is constant, we may take
$\sigma(x,y)=1$. 

It is clear that $\bar x=0$, but for practice let's
compute it anyway. First we compute the mass:
$$
M=\int_{-\pi/2}^{\pi/2} \int_0^{\cos x} 1\,dy\,dx
=\int_{-\pi/2}^{\pi/2} \cos x\,dx
=\left.\sin x\right|_{-\pi/2}^{\pi/2}=2.
$$
Next,
$$
M_x=\int_{-\pi/2}^{\pi/2} \int_0^{\cos x} y\,dy\,dx
=\int_{-\pi/2}^{\pi/2} {1\over2}\cos^2 x\,dx={\pi\over4}.
$$
Finally,
$$
M_y=\int_{-\pi/2}^{\pi/2} \int_0^{\cos x} x\,dy\,dx
=\int_{-\pi/2}^{\pi/2} x\cos x\,dx=0.
$$
So $\bar x=0$ as expected, and $\bar y=\pi/4/2=\pi/8$. 
This is the same problem as in example~\xrefn{exam:center of mass
  under cos}; it may be helpful to compare the two solutions.

\example Find the center of mass of a two-dimensional plate 
that occupies the quarter circle $x^2+y^2\le1$ in the
first quadrant and has density
$k(x^2+y^2)$. It seems clear that because of the symmetry of both the
region and the density function (both are important!), $\bar x=\bar
y$. We'll do both to check our work.

Jumping right in:
$$
M=\int_0^1 \int_0^{\sqrt{1-x^2}} k(x^2+y^2)\,dy\,dx
=k\int_0^1 x^2\sqrt{1-x^2}+{(1-x^2)^{3/2}\over3}\,dx.
$$
This integral is something we can do, but it's a bit unpleasant. Since
everything in sight is related to a circle, let's back up and try
polar coordinates. Then $x^2+y^2=r^2$ and
$$M=\int_0^{\pi/2} \int_0^{1} k(r^2)\,r\,dr\,d\theta
=k\int_0^{\pi/2}\left.{r^4\over4}\right|_0^1\,d\theta
=k\int_0^{\pi/2} {1\over4}\,d\theta
=k{\pi\over8}.
$$
Much better. Next, since $y=r\sin\theta$,
$$M_x=k\int_0^{\pi/2} \int_0^{1} r^4\sin\theta\,dr\,d\theta
=k\int_0^{\pi/2} {1\over5}\sin\theta\,d\theta
=k\left.-{1\over5}\cos\theta\right|_0^{\pi/2}={k\over5}.
$$
Similarly,
$$M_y=k\int_0^{\pi/2} \int_0^{1} r^4\cos\theta\,dr\,d\theta
=k\int_0^{\pi/2} {1\over5}\cos\theta\,d\theta
=k\left.{1\over5}\sin\theta\right|_0^{\pi/2}={k\over5}.
$$
Finally, $\ds\bar x = \bar y = {8\over5\pi}$.
