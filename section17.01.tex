We start by considering equations in which only the first derivative
of the function appears. 

\defn A {\dfont first order differential 
equation\index{differential equation!first order}\/} is an equation of
the form
$F(t, y, \dot{y})=0$.
A solution of a first order differential equation is a
function $f(t)$ that makes $\ds F(t,f(t),f'(t))=0$ for every value of $t$.
\enddef

Here, $F$ is a function of three
variables which we label $t$, $y$, and $\dot{y}$. It is understood
that $\dot{y} $ will explicitly appear in the equation although $t$
and $y$ need not. The term ``first order'' means that the first
derivative of $y$ appears, but no higher order derivatives do.

\example The equation from Newton's law of cooling,
$\dot{y}=k(M-y)$ is a first order
differential equation; $F(t,y,\dot y)=k(M-y)-\dot y$.
\endexample

\example $\ds\dot{y}=t^2+1$ is a first order differential
equation; $\ds F(t,y,\dot y)= \dot y-t^2-1$. All solutions to this
equation are of the form $\ds t^3/3+t+C$. 
\endexample

\defn A {\dfont first order initial value 
problem\index{initial value problem!first order}\/} is a system of
equations of the form
$F(t, y, \dot{y})=0$, $y(t_0)=y_0$. Here $t_0 $ is a fixed time
and $y_0$ is a number.
A solution of an initial value problem is a solution $f(t)$ of
the differential equation that also satisfies the 
{\dfont initial condition\index{initial condition}\/}
$f(t_0) = y_0$.
\enddef

\example The initial value problem $\ds\dot{y}=t^2+1$, $y(1)=4$
has solution $\ds f(t)=t^3/3+t+8/3$.
\endexample

The general first order equation is rather too general, that is, 
we can't describe methods that will work on them all, or even a large
portion of them. We can make progress with specific kinds of
first order differential equations.
For example, much can be said about equations of the form
$\ds \dot{y} = \phi (t, y)$ where $\phi $
is a function of the two variables $t$ and $y$.
Under reasonable conditions on $\phi$, such an
equation has a solution and the corresponding 
initial value problem has a unique solution.
However, in general, these equations can be very difficult or
impossible to solve explicitly.

\example Consider this specific example of an initial value problem
for Newton's law of cooling: $\dot y = 2(25-y)$, $y(0)=40$. We first
note that if $y(t_0) = 25$, the right hand side of the differential
equation is zero, and so the constant function $y(t)=25$ is a solution
to the differential equation. It is not a solution to the initial
value problem, since $y(0)\not=40$.  (The physical interpretation of
this constant solution is that if a liquid is at the same temperature
as its surroundings, then the liquid will stay at that temperature.)
So long as $y$ is not 25, we can rewrite the differential equation as
$$\eqalign{{dy\over dt}{1\over 25-y}&=2\cr
{1\over 25-y}\,dy&=2\,dt,\cr}
$$
so 
$$\int {1\over 25-y}\,dy = \int 2\,dt,$$
that is, the two anti-derivatives must be the same except for a
constant difference. We can calculate these anti-derivatives and 
rearrange the results:
$$\eqalign{
\int {1\over 25-y}\,dy &= \int 2\,dt\cr
(-1)\ln|25-y| &= 2t+C_0\cr
\ln|25-y| &= -2t - C_0 = -2t + C\cr
|25-y| &= e^{-2t+C}=e^{-2t} e^C\cr
y-25 & = \pm\, e^C e^{-2t} \cr
y &= 25 \pm e^C e^{-2t} =25+Ae^{-2t}.\cr}$$
Here $\ds A = \pm\, e^C = \pm\, e^{-C_0}$ 
is some non-zero constant. Since we want
$y(0)=40$, we substitute and solve for $A$:
$$\eqalign{
40&=25+Ae^0\cr
15&=A,\cr}$$
and so $\ds y=25+15 e^{-2t}$ is a solution to the initial value
problem. Note that $y$ is never 25, so this makes sense for all values
of $t$. However, if we allow $A=0$ we get the solution
$y=25$ to the differential equation, which would be the solution to
the initial value problem if we were to require $y(0)=25$. Thus, 
$\ds y=25+Ae^{-2t}$ describes all solutions to the differential
equation $\ds\dot y = 2(25-y)$, and all solutions to the associated
initial value problems. 
\endexample

Why could we solve this problem? Our solution depended on rewriting
the equation so that all instances of $y$ were on one side of the
equation and all instances of $t$ were on the other; of course, in
this case the only $t$ was originally hidden, since we didn't write
$dy/dt$ in the original equation. This is not required, however.

\example Solve the differential equation $\ds\dot y = 2t(25-y)$.
This is almost identical to the previous example. As before, $y(t)=25$
is a solution. If $y\not=25$,
$$\eqalign{
\int {1\over 25-y}\,dy &= \int 2t\,dt\cr
(-1)\ln|25-y| &= t^2+C_0\cr
\ln|25-y| &= -t^2 - C_0 = -t^2 + C\cr
|25-y| &= e^{-t^2+C}=e^{-t^2} e^C\cr
y-25 & = \pm\, e^C e^{-t^2} \cr
y &= 25 \pm e^C e^{-t^2} =25+Ae^{-t^2}.\cr}$$
As before, all solutions are represented by $\ds y=25+Ae^{-t^2}$,
allowing $A$ to be zero.

\defn A first order differential equation is 
{\dfont separable\index{differential equation!separable}\/} if it
can be written in the form
$\dot{y} = f(t) g(y)$.
\enddef

As in the examples, we can attempt to solve a separable equation by
converting to the form
$$\int {1\over g(y)}\,dy=\int f(t)\,dt.$$
This technique is called {\dfont separation of
  variables\index{separation of variables}}. The simplest (in
principle) sort of separable equation is one in which $g(y)=1$, in
which case we attempt to solve
$$\int 1\,dy=\int f(t)\,dt.$$
We can do this if we can find an anti-derivative of $f(t)$.

Also as we have seen so far, a differential equation
typically has an infinite number of solutions. Ideally, but certainly
not always, a corresponding initial value problem will have just one
solution. A solution in which there are no unknown constants remaining
is called a {\dfont particular 
solution\index{particular solution}\index{differential equation!particular solution}}.

The general approach to separable equations is this:
Suppose we wish to solve $\dot{y} =
f(t) g(y) $ where $f$ and $g$ are continuous functions. If $g(a)=0$
for some $a$ then $y(t)=a$ is a constant solution of the equation,
since in this case $\dot y = 0 = f(t)g(a)$.  For example, $\dot{y}
=y^2 -1$ has constant solutions $y(t)=1$ and $y(t)=-1$.

To find the nonconstant solutions, we note that the function
$1/g(y)$ is continuous where $g\not=0$, so
$1/g$ has an antiderivative $G$. Let $F$ be an
antiderivative of $f$.  
Now we write 
$$G(y) = \int {1\over g(y)}\,dy = \int f(t)\,dt=F(t)+C,$$
so $G(y)=F(t)+C$. Now we solve this equation for $y$. 

Of course, there are a few places this ideal description could go
wrong: we need to be able to find the antiderivatives $G$ and $F$, and
we need to solve the final equation for $y$.
The upshot is that the solutions to the original differential equation
are the constant solutions, if any, and all functions $y$ that satisfy
$G(y)=F(t)+C$.


\example Consider the differential equation $\dot y=ky$.
\exrdef{exer:first simple linear homogeneous}
When $k>0$, this describes certain simple cases of population growth:
it says that the change in the population $y$ is proportional to the
population. The underlying assumption is that each organism in the
current population reproduces at a fixed rate, so the larger the
population the more new organisms are produced. While this is too
simple to model most real populations, it is useful in some cases over
a limited time. When $k<0$, the differential equation describes a
quantity that decreases in proportion to the current value; this can
be used to model radioactive decay.

The constant solution is $y(t)=0$; of course this will not be the
solution to any interesting initial value problem. 
For the non-constant solutions, we proceed much as before:
$$\eqalign{
\int {1\over y}\,dy&=\int k\,dt\cr
\ln|y| &= kt+C\cr
|y| &= e^{kt} e^C\cr
y &= \pm \,e^C e^{kt} \cr
y&= Ae^{kt}.\cr}$$
Again, if we allow $A=0$ this includes the constant solution, and we
can simply say that $\ds y=Ae^{kt}$ is the general solution. With an
initial value we can easily solve for $A$ to get the solution of the
initial value problem. In particular, if the initial value is
given for time $t=0$, $y(0)=y_0$, then $A=y_0$ and the solution
is $\ds y= y_0 e^{kt}$.
