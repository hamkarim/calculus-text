\section{Maxima and minima}{}{}

Suppose a surface given by $f(x,y)$ has a local maximum at
$(x_0,y_0,z_0)$; geometrically, this point on the surface looks like
the top of a hill. If we look at the cross-section in the plane
$y=y_0$, we will see a local maximum on the curve at $(x_0,z_0)$, and
we know from single-variable calculus that ${\partial z\over\partial x}=0$
at this point. Likewise, in the plane $x=x_0$, ${\partial
  z\over\partial y}=0$. So if there is a local maximum at
$(x_0,y_0,z_0)$, both partial derivatives at the point must be zero,
and likewise for a local minimum. Thus, to find local maximum and
minimum points, we need only consider those points at which both
partial derivatives are 0. As in the single-variable case, it is
possible for the derivatives to be 0 at a point that is neither a
maximum or a minimum, so we need to test these points further.

You will recall that in the single variable case, we examined three
methods to identify maximum and minimum points; the most useful is the
second derivative test, though it does not always work. For functions
of two variables there is also a second derivative test; again it is
by far the most useful test, though it doesn't always work.

\thm Suppose that the second partial derivatives of $f(x,y)$ are
continuous near $(x_0,y_0)$, and $f_x(x_0,y_0)=f_y(x_0,y_0)=0$.
We denote by $D$ the {\dfont discriminant\index{discriminant}}
$D(x_0,y_0)=f_{xx}(x_0,y_0)f_{yy}(x_0,y_0)-f_{xy}(x_0,y_0)^2$.
If $D>0$ and $f_{xx}(x_0,y_0)<0$ there is a local maximum at $(x_0,y_0)$;
if $D>0$ and $f_{xx}(x_0,y_0)>0$ there is a local minimum at $(x_0,y_0)$;
if $D<0$ there is neither a maximum nor a minimum at $(x_0,y_0)$;
if $D=0$, the test fails.
\endthmnoproof

\example Verify that $f(x,y)=x^2+y^2$ has a minimum at $(0,0)$.

First, we compute all the needed derivatives:
$$f_x=2x \qquad f_y=2y \qquad f_{xx}=2 \qquad f_{yy}=2 \qquad
f_{xy}=0.$$
The derivatives $f_x$ and $f_y$ are zero only at $(0,0)$. Applying the
second derivative test there:
$$D(0,0)=f_{xx}(0,0)f_{yy}(0,0)-f_{xy}(0,0)^2=
2\cdot2-0=4>0,$$
so there is a local minimum at $(0,0)$, and there are no other
possibilities. 
\endexample

\example Find all local maxima and minima for $f(x,y)=x^2-y^2$.

The derivatives:
$$f_x=2x \qquad f_y=-2y \qquad f_{xx}=2 \qquad f_{yy}=-2 \qquad
f_{xy}=0.$$
Again there is a single critical point, at $(0,0)$, and
$$D(0,0)=f_{xx}(0,0)f_{yy}(0,0)-f_{xy}(0,0)^2=
2\cdot-2-0=-4<0,$$
so there is neither a maximum nor minimum there, and so there are no
local maxima or minima. The surface is shown in
figure~\xrefn{fig:saddle}.

\example Find all local maxima and minima for $f(x,y)=x^4+y^4$.

The derivatives:
$$f_x=4x^3 \qquad f_y=4y^3 \qquad f_{xx}=12x^2 \qquad f_{yy}=12y^2 \qquad
f_{xy}=0.$$
Again there is a single critical point, at $(0,0)$, and
$$D(0,0)=f_{xx}(0,0)f_{yy}(0,0)-f_{xy}(0,0)^2=
0\cdot0-0=0,$$
so we get no information. However, in this case it is easy to see that
there is a minimum at $(0,0)$, because $f(0,0)=0$ and
at all other points $f(x,y)>0$.
\endexample

\example Find all local maxima and minima for $f(x,y)=x^3+y^3$.

The derivatives:
$$f_x=3x^2 \qquad f_y=3y^2 \qquad f_{xx}=6x^2 \qquad f_{yy}=6y^2 \qquad
f_{xy}=0.$$
Again there is a single critical point, at $(0,0)$, and
$$D(0,0)=f_{xx}(0,0)f_{yy}(0,0)-f_{xy}(0,0)^2=
0\cdot0-0=0,$$
so we get no information. In this case, a little thought shows there
is neither a maximum nor a minimum at $(0,0)$: when $x$ and $y$ are
both positive, $f(x,y)>0$, and when $x$ and $y$ are
both negative, $f(x,y)<0$, and there are points of both kinds
arbitrarily close to $(0,0)$. Alternately, if we look at the
cross-section when $y=0$, we get $f(x,0)=x^3$, which does not have
either a maximum or minimum at $x=0$.
\endexample

\example Suppose a box with no top is to hold a certain volume $V$. Find
the dimensions for the box that result in the minimum surface area.

The area of the box is $A=2hw+2hl+lw$, and the volume is $V=lwh$, so
we can write the area as a function of two variables,
$$A(l,w)={2V\over l}+{2V\over w}+lw.$$
Then
$$A_l=-{2V\over l^2}+w \hbox{\quad and\quad} A_w=-{2V\over w^2}+l.$$
If we set these equal to zero and solve, we find
$\ds w=(2V)^{1/3}$ and $\ds l=(2V)^{1/3}$, and the corresponding
height is $h=V/(2V)^{2/3}$.

The second derivatives are
$$A_{ll}={4V\over l^3}\qquad A_{ww}={4V\over w^3}\qquad
A_{lw}=1,$$
so the discriminant is
$$D={4V\over l^3}{4V\over w^3}-1=4-1=3>0.$$
Since $A_{ll}$ is 2, there is a local minimum at the critical point.
Is this a global minimum? It is, but it is difficult to see this
analytically; physically and graphically it is clear that there is a
minimum, in which case it must be at the single critical point.

Recall that when we did single variable global maximum and minimum
problems, the easiest cases were those for which the variable could be
limited to a finite closed interval, for then we simply had to check
all critical values and the endpoints. The previous example is
difficult because there is no finite boundary to the domain of the
problem---both $w$ and $l$ can be in $(0,\infty)$. As in the single
variable case, the problem is often simpler when there is a finite
boundary. 

\thm If $f(x,y)$ is continuous on a closed and bounded subset of
$\R^2$, then it has both a maximum and minimum value.
\endthmnoproof

As in the case of single variable functions, this means that the
maximum and minimum values must occur at a critical point or on the
boundary; in the two variable case, however, the boundary is a curve,
not merely two endpoints.

\example The length of the diagonal of a box is to be 1 meter; find the
maximum possible volume.
\thmrdef{exam:box diagonal}

If the box is placed with one corner at the origin, and sides along
the axes, the length of the diagonal is $\ds\sqrt{x^2+y^2+z^2}$, and
the volume is
$$V=xyz=xy\sqrt{1-x^2-y^2}.$$
Clearly, $x^2+y^2\le 1$, so the domain we are interested in
is the quarter of the unit disk in the first quadrant.
Computing derivatives:
$$\eqalign{
V_x&={y-2yx^2-y^3\over\sqrt{1-x^2-y^2}}\cr
V_y&={x-2xy^2-x^3\over\sqrt{1-x^2-y^2}}\cr
}$$
If these are both 0, then $x=0$ or $y=0$, or $x=y=1/\sqrt3$. The boundary of
the domain is composed of three curves: $x=0$ for $y\in[0,1]$; $y=0$
for $x\in[0,1]$; and $x^2+y^2=1$, where $x\ge0$ and $y\ge0$. In all
three cases, the volume  $xy\sqrt{1-x^2-y^2}$ is 0, so the maximum
occurs at the only critical point $(1/\sqrt3,1/\sqrt3,\sqrt3/9)$. See
figure~\xrefn{fig:max volume}.
