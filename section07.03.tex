\section{Some Properties of Integrals}{}{}
\nobreak
Suppose an object moves so that its speed, or more properly velocity,
is given by $\ds v(t)=-t^2+5t$, as shown in figure~\xrefn{fig:speed can be
negative}. Let's examine the motion of this object carefully. We know
that the velocity is the derivative of position, so position is 
given by $\ds s(t)=-t^3/3+5t^2/2+C$. Let's suppose that at time $t=0$ the
object is at position 0, so $\ds s(t)=-t^3/3+5t^2/2$; this function is
also pictured in figure~\xrefn{fig:speed can be
negative}.

Between $t=0$ and $t=5$ the velocity is positive, so the object moves
away from the starting point, until it is a bit past position 20. Then
the velocity becomes negative and the object moves back toward its
starting point. The position of the object at $t=5$ is exactly 
$s(5)=125/6$, and at $t=6$ it is $s(6)=18$. The total distance
traveled by the object is therefore $125/6 + (125/6 - 18) =
71/3\approx 23.7$. 

As we have seen, we can also compute distance traveled with an
integral; let's try it.
$$
  \int_0^6 v(t)\,dt = \int_0^6 -t^2+5t\,dt = 
\left.{-t^3\over 3}+{5\over2}t^2\right|_0^6  = 
18.
$$
What went wrong? Well, nothing really, except that it's not really
true after all that ``we can also compute distance traveled with an
integral''. Instead, as you might guess from this example, the
integral actually computes the {\it net\/} distance traveled, that is,
the difference between the starting and ending point.

As we have already seen,
$$
  \int_0^6 v(t)\,dt=\int_0^5 v(t)\,dt+\int_5^6 v(t)\,dt.
$$
Computing the two integrals on the right (do it!) gives
$125/6$ and $-17/6$, and the sum of these is indeed 18. But what does
that negative sign mean? It means precisely what you might think: it
means that the object moves backwards. To get the total distance
traveled we can add $125/6+17/6=71/3$, the same answer we got before.

Remember that we can also interpret an integral as measuring an area,
but now we see that this too is a little more complicated that we have
suspected. The area under the curve $v(t)$ from 0 to 5 is given by 
$$
  \int_0^5 v(t)\,dt={125\over6},
$$
and the ``area'' from 5 to 6 is 
$$
  \int_5^6 v(t)\,dt=-{17\over 6}.
$$
In other words, the area between the $x$-axis and the curve, but under
the $x$-axis, ``counts as negative area''. So the integral
$$
  \int_0^6 v(t)\,dt=18
$$ 
measures ``net area'', the area above the axis minus the (positive)
area below the axis.

If we recall that the integral is the limit of a certain kind of sum,
this behavior is not surprising. Recall the sort of sum involved:
$$
  \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} v(t_i)\Delta t.
$$
In each term $v(t)\Delta t$ the $\Delta t$ is positive, but if
$\ds v(t_i)$ is negative then the term is negative. If over an entire
interval, like 5 to 6, the function is always negative, then the
entire sum is negative. In terms of area, $v(t)\Delta t$ is then a
negative height times a positive width, giving a negative rectangle
``area''. 

So now we see that when evaluating $$\ds\int_5^6 v(t)\,dt=-{17\over 6}$$
by finding an antiderivative, substituting, and subtracting, we get a
surprising answer, but one that turns out to make sense.

Let's now try something a bit different:
$$
  \int_6^5 v(t)\,dt=\left.{-t^3\over 3}+{5\over2}t^2\right|_6^5 =
  {-5^3\over 3}+{5\over2}5^2-{-6^3\over 3}-{5\over2}6^2 ={17\over 6}.
$$
Here we simply interchanged the limits 5 and 6, so of course when we
substitute and subtract we're subtracting in the opposite order and we
end up multiplying the answer by $-1$. This too makes sense in terms
of the underlying sum, though it takes a bit more thought. Recall that
in the sum
$$
  \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} v(t_i)\Delta t,
$$
the $\Delta t$ is the ``length'' of each little subinterval, but more
precisely we could say that $\ds \Delta t = t_{i+1}-t_i$, the difference
between two endpoints of a subinterval. We have until now assumed that
we were working left to right, but could as well number the
subintervals from right to left, so that $\ds t_0=b$ and $\ds t_n=a$.
Then $\ds \Delta t=t_{i+1}-t_i$ is negative and
in 
$$
  \int_6^5 v(t)\,dt=\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} v(t_i)\Delta t,
$$
the values $\ds v(t_i)$ are negative but also $\Delta t$ is negative, so all
terms are positive again. On the other hand, in
$$
  \int_5^0 v(t)\,dt=\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} v(t_i)\Delta t,
$$
the values $\ds v(t_i)$ are positive but $\Delta t$ is negative,and we get
a negative result:
$$
  \int_5^0 v(t)\,dt=\left.{-t^3\over 3}+{5\over2}t^2\right|_5^0 =
  0-{-5^3\over 3}-{5\over2}5^2 = -{125\over6}.
$$

Finally we note one simple property of integrals:
$$
  \int_a^b f(x)+g(x)\,dx=\int_a^b f(x)\,dx+\int_a^b g(x)\,dx.
$$
This is easy to understand once you recall that
$(F(x)+G(x))'=F'(x)+G'(x)$. Hence, if $F'(x)=f(x)$ and $G'(x)=g(x)$,
then
$$
  \eqalign{
  \int_a^b f(x)+g(x)\,dx&=\left.(F(x)+G(x))\right|_a^b\cr
  &=F(b)+G(b)-F(a)-G(a)\cr
  &=F(b)-F(a)+G(b)-G(a)\cr
  &=\left.F(x)\right|_a^b+\left.G(x)\right|_a^b\cr
  &=\int_a^b f(x)\,dx+\int_a^b g(x)\,dx.\cr
  }
$$

In summary, we will frequently use these properties of 
\index{properties of integrals}\index{integral!properties of}integrals:
$$\displaylines{
  \int_a^b f(x)\,dx = \int_a^c f(x)\,dx + \int_c^b f(x)\,dx\cr
  \int_a^b f(x)+g(x)\,dx=\int_a^b f(x)\,dx+\int_a^b g(x)\,dx\cr
  \int_a^b f(x)\,dx=-\int_b^a f(x)\,dx\cr
}$$
and if $a<b$ and $f(x)\le 0$ on $[a,b]$ then
$$
  \int_a^b f(x)\,dx\le 0$$
and in fact
$$
  \int_a^b f(x)\,dx=-\int_a^b |f(x)|\,dx.
$$
