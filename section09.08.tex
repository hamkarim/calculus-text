You perhaps have at least a rudimentary understanding of
{\dfont discrete probability\index{discrete probability}}, which
measures the likelihood of an ``event'' when there are a finite number
of possibilities. For example, when an ordinary six-sided die is
rolled, the probability of getting any particular number is $1/6$. In
general, the probability of an event is the number of ways the event
can happen divided by the number of ways that ``anything'' can happen.

For a slightly more complicated example, consider the case of two
six-sided dice. The dice are physically distinct, which means that
rolling a 2--5 is different than rolling a 5--2; each is an equally
likely event out of a total of 36 ways the dice can land, so each has
a probability of $1/36$.

Most interesting events are not so simple. More interesting is the
probability of rolling a certain sum out of the possibilities 2
through 12. It is clearly not true that all sums are equally likely:
the only way to roll a 2 is to roll 1--1, while there are many ways to
roll a 7. Because the number of possibilities is quite small, and
because a pattern quickly becomes evident, it is easy to see that the
probabilities of the various sums are:
$$\eqalign{
  P(2) =P(12)  &=1/36\cr  
  P(3) = P(11) &= 2/36\cr
  P(4) =P(10)  &= 3/36\cr
  P(5) =P(9)   &= 4/36\cr
  P(6) =P(8)   &= 5/36\cr
  P(7)         &=6/36\cr
}$$
Here we use $P(n)$ to mean ``the probability of rolling an $n$.''
Since we have correctly accounted for all possibilities, the sum of
all these probabilities is $36/36=1$; the probability that the sum is
one of 2 through 12 is 1, because there are no other possibilities.

The study of probability is concerned with more difficult questions as
well; for example, suppose the two dice are rolled many times. On the
average, what sum will come up? In the language of probability, this
average is called the {\dfont expected value\index{expected value}\/}
of the sum. This is at first a little misleading, as it does not tell
us what to ``expect'' when the two dice are rolled, but what we expect
the long term average will be.

Suppose that two dice are rolled 36 million times. Based on the
probabilities, we would expect about 1 million rolls to be 2, about 2
million to be 3, and so on, with a roll of 7 topping the list at about
6 million. The sum of all rolls would be 1 million times 2 plus 2
million times 3, and so on, and dividing by 36
million we would get the average:
$$\eqalign{
  \bar x&=
  (2\cdot 10^6+3(2\cdot 10^6) +\cdots+7(6\cdot 10^6)+\cdots+12\cdot10^6)
  {1\over 36\cdot 10^6}\cr
  &=2{10^6\over 36\cdot 10^6}+3{2\cdot 10^6\over 36\cdot 10^6}+\cdots+
  7{6\cdot 10^6\over 36\cdot 10^6}+\cdots+12{10^6\over 36\cdot 10^6}\cr
  &=2P(2)+3P(3)+\cdots+7P(7)+\cdots+12P(12)\cr
  &=\sum_{i=2}^{12} iP(i)=7.}
$$
There is nothing special about the 36 million in
this calculation. No matter what the number of rolls, once we simplify
the average, we get the same $\ds\sum_{i=2}^{12} iP(i)$. While the
actual average value of a large number of rolls will not be exactly 7,
the average should be close to 7 when the number of rolls is
large. Turning this around, if the average is not close to 7, we
should suspect that the dice are not fair.

A variable, say $X$, that can take certain values, each with a
corresponding probability, is called a {\dfont random
variable\index{random variable}}; in the example above, the random
variable was the sum of the two dice. If the possible values for $X$
are $\ds x_1$, $\ds x_2$,\dots,$\ds x_n$, then 
the expected value of the random
variable is $\ds E(X)=\sum_{i=1}^n x_iP(x_i)$. The expected value is
also called the {\dfont mean\index{mean}}.

When the number of possible values for $X$ is finite, we say that $X$
is a discrete random variable.  In many applications of probability,
the number of possible values of a random variable is very large,
perhaps even infinite. To deal with the infinite case we need a
different approach, and since there is a sum involved, it should not
be wholly surprising that integration turns out to be a useful
tool. It then turns out that even when the number of possibilities is
large but finite, it is frequently easier to pretend that the number
is infinite. Suppose, for example, that a dart is thrown at a dart
board. Since the dart board consists of a finite number of atoms,
there are in some sense only a finite number of places for the dart to
land, but it is easier to explore the probabilities involved by
pretending that the dart can land on any point in the usual $x$-$y$
plane.

\defn Let $f:\R \to \R$ be a
function. If $f(x) \geq 0$ for every $x$ and $\ds\int_{-\infty }
^\infty f(x)\,dx = 1$ then $f$ is a {\dfont probability density
function\index{probability density function}}.
\enddef

We associate a probability density
function with a random variable $X$ by stipulating that the
probability that $X$ is between $a$ and $b$ is 
$\ds\int_a^b f(x)\,dx$. Because of the requirement that the integral
from $-\infty$ to $\infty$ be 1, all probabilities are less than or
equal to 1, and 
the probability that $X$ takes on some value
between $-\infty$ and $\infty$ is 1, as it should be.

\example Consider again the two dice example; we can view it in a way
that more resembles the probability density function
approach. Consider a random variable $X$ that takes on any real value
with probabilities given by the probability density function in
figure~\xrefn{fig:two dice}. The function $f$ consists of just the top
edges of the rectangles, with vertical sides drawn for clarity; the
function is zero below $1.5$ and above $12.5$.
The area of each rectangle is the probability of rolling the sum in
the middle of the bottom of the rectangle, or
$$P(n) = \int_{n-1/2}^{n+1/2} f(x)\,dx.$$
The probability of rolling a 4, 5, or 6 is
$$P(n) = \int_{7/2}^{13/2} f(x)\,dx.$$
Of course, we could also compute probabilities that don't make sense
in the context of the dice, such as the probability that 
$X$ is between 4 and $5.8$.

The function

is called the {\dfont cumulative distribution

\thmrdef{exam:normal distribution}
Consider the function $\ds f(x) = e^{-x^2/2}$. What can we say about 
$$\int_{-\infty }^\infty e^{-x^2/2}\,dx?$$ 
We cannot find an antiderivative of $f$, but we can see that this
integral is some finite number.
Notice that $\ds 0< f(x) = e^{-x^2/2} \leq e^{-x/2}$ for
$|x| > 1$. This implies that the area under $\ds e^{-x^2/2}$ is less
than the area under $\ds e^{-x/2}$, over the interval $[1,\infty)$.
It is easy to compute the latter area, namely
$$\int_1^\infty e^{-x/2}\,dx = {2\over\sqrt{e}},$$
so 
$$\int_1^\infty e^{-x^2/2}\,dx$$
is some finite number smaller than $\ds 2/\sqrt{e}$.
Because $f$ is symmetric around the $y$-axis,
$$\int_{-\infty }^{-1} e^{-x^2/2}\,dx=\int_1^\infty e^{-x^2/2}\,dx.$$
This means that 
$$
  \int_{-\infty }^\infty e^{-x^2/2}\,dx
  =\int_{-\infty}^{-1}
  e^{-x^2/2}\,dx + \int_{-1}^1 e^{-x^2/2}\,dx + \int_1^\infty
  e^{-x^2/2}\,dx = A
$$
for some finite positive number $A$.
Now if we let $g(x) = f(x)/A$,
$$
  \int_{-\infty }^\infty g(x)\,dx =
  {1\over A}\int_{-\infty }^\infty e^{-x^2/2}\,dx = 
  {1\over A} A = 1,
$$
so $g$ is a probability density function. It turns out to be very
useful, and is called the {\dfont standard normal probability density
function\index{standard normal probability density function}\/} or
more informally the {\dfont bell curve\index{bell curve}}, giving rise
to the {\dfont standard normal distribution\index{standard normal
distribution}}.  See figure~\xrefn{fig:bell curve} for the graph
of the bell curve.

$\ds A=\sqrt{2\pi}$.

\thmrdef{exam:exponential distribution}
The {\dfont exponential distribution\index{exponential
    distribution}} has probability density function 
$$f(x) =\cases{ 0 & $x< 0$\cr
ce^{-cx } & $x\geq 0$\cr}$$
where $c$ is a positive
constant.
\endexample

% \defn Let $f$ be a probability density function. Since we are
% assuming that the function $\ds F(x) =\int_{-\infty }^x
% f(t)\,dt$ is continuous and ranges from $0$ to $1$ it follows by the
% intermediate value theorem that there is at least one number $m$ such that $F(m)
% =1/2$; $m$ is called a {\dfont median\index{median}\/} of the random
% variable $X$. Note that
% $P(X \leq m) = P(X\geq m) =1/2$.

% 
%  \defn If a probability density function $f$ has a global
%  maximum at $x=c$ then $c$ is a {\dfont mode\index{mode}} 
% of the random variable $X$.
% \enddef
% 
% There need not be a single mode; for example, in the uniform
% distribution every number between $a$ and $b$ is a
% mode. The mode may not even exist, though it is a bit tricky to come
% up with an example.

% \example\relax
% \thmrdef{exam:no mode}
% It is somewhat difficult to devise a continuous probability density

% $$
% Sketch this graph; it is then apparent that $f$ has no
% global maximum and hence no
% mode. 
% \endexample

% In practice, both the mode and the median are useful, but the expected
% value, also called the mean, is generally most useful. Following our
% discussion of discrete probability, the definition should not be
% surprising. 

The mean or expected value of a random variable is quite useful, as
hinted at in our discussion of dice. Recall that the mean for a 
discrete random variable is $\ds E(X)=\sum_{i=1}^n x_iP(x_i)$. In the
more general context we use an integral in place of the sum.

\defn The {\dfont mean\index{mean}\/} 
of a random variable $X$ with probability density function $f$ is
$\ds \mu = E(X)=\int_{-\infty }^\infty xf(x)\,dx$,
provided the integral converges.
\enddef

When the mean exists it is unique, since it is the result of an
explicit calculation. The mean does not always exist.

The mean might look familiar; it is
essentially identical to the center of mass of a
one-dimensional beam, as discussed in section~\xrefn{sec:center of mass}.
The probability density function $f$ plays the role of the physical
density function, but now the ``beam'' has infinite length.
If we consider only a finite portion of the beam, say between $a$ and
$b$, then the center of mass is
$$\bar x = {\ds\int_a^b xf(x)\,dx\over\ds\int_a^b f(x)\,dx}.$$
If we extend the beam to infinity, we get
$$
  \bar x = {\ds\int_{-\infty}^\infty xf(x)\,dx\over
  \ds\int_{-\infty}^\infty f(x)\,dx} = \int_{-\infty}^\infty
  xf(x)\,dx = E(X),
$$
because $\ds \int_{-\infty}^\infty f(x)\,dx=1$. In the center of mass
interpretation, this integral is the total mass of the beam, which is
always 1 when $f$ is a probability density function.

\example
The mean of the standard normal distribution is 
$$\int_{-\infty}^\infty x {e^{-x^2/2}\over\sqrt{2\pi}}\,dx.$$
We compute the two halves:
$$
  \int_{-\infty}^0 x{e^{-x^2/2}\over\sqrt{2\pi}}\,dx=
  \lim_{D\to-\infty}\left.-{e^{-x^2/2}\over\sqrt{2\pi}}\right|_D^0=
  -{1\over\sqrt{2\pi}}
$$
and 
$$
  \int_0^\infty x{e^{-x^2/2}\over\sqrt{2\pi}}\,dx=
  \lim_{D\to\infty}\left.-{e^{-x^2/2}\over\sqrt{2\pi}}\right|_0^D=
  {1\over\sqrt{2\pi}}.
$$
The sum of these is 0, which is the mean.
\endexample

While the mean is very useful, it typically is not enough information
to properly evaluate a situation. For example, suppose we could
manufacture an 11-sided die, with the faces numbered 2 through 12 so
that each face is equally likely to be down when the die is
rolled. The value of a roll is the value on this lower face.  Rolling
the die gives the same range of values as rolling two ordinary dice,
but now each value occurs with probability $1/11$. The expected value
of a roll is
$$ {2\over 11} + {3\over 11} + \cdots + {12\over 11} = 7.$$
The mean does not distinguish the two cases, though of course they are
quite different.

If $f$ is a probability density function for a random variable $X$,
with mean $\mu$, we would like to measure how far a ``typical'' value
of $X$ is from $\mu$. One way to measure this distance is
$\ds(X-\mu)^2$; we square the difference so as to measure all
distances as positive. To get the typical such squared distance, we
compute the mean. For two dice, for example, we get
$$
  (2-7)^2{1\over 36} + (3-7)^2{2\over 36} + \cdots + (7-7)^2{6\over 36}
  +\cdots (11-7)^2{2\over36} + (12-7)^2{1\over36} = {35\over36}.
$$
Because we squared the differences this does not directly measure the
typical distance we seek; if we take the square root of this we do get
such a measure, $\ds\sqrt{35/36}\approx 2.42$. Doing the computation
for the strange 11-sided die we get
$$
  (2-7)^2{1\over 11} + (3-7)^2{1\over 11} + \cdots + (7-7)^2{1\over 11}
  +\cdots (11-7)^2{1\over11} + (12-7)^2{1\over11} = 10,
$$
with square root approximately 3.16. Comparing 2.42 to 3.16 tells us
that the two-dice rolls clump somewhat more closely near 7
than the rolls of the weird die, which of course we
already knew because these examples are quite simple.

To perform the same computation for a probability density function the
sum is replaced by an integral, just as in the computation of the
mean. The expected value of the squared distances is
$$V(X)= \int_{-\infty }^\infty (x-\mu)^2 f(x)\,dx,$$
called the {\dfont variance\index{variance}\/}. The square root of the
variance is the {\dfont standard deviation\index{standard
deviation}\/}, denoted $\sigma$.

\example We compute the standard deviation of the standard normal
distrubution. The variance is
$${1\over\sqrt{2\pi}}\int_{-\infty}^\infty x^2 e^{-x^2/2}\,dx.$$
To compute the antiderivative, use integration by parts, with
$u=x$ and $\ds dv=xe^{-x^2/2}\,dx$. This gives
$$\int x^2 e^{-x^2/2}\,dx = -x e^{-x^2/2}+\int e^{-x^2/2}\,dx.$$
We cannot do the new integral, but we know its value when the limits
are $-\infty$ to $\infty$, from our discussion of the 
standard normal distribution. Thus
$$
  {1\over\sqrt{2\pi}}\int_{-\infty}^\infty x^2 e^{-x^2/2}\,dx=
  \left.-{1\over\sqrt{2\pi}}x e^{-x^2/2}\right|_{-\infty}^\infty + 
  {1\over\sqrt{2\pi}}\int_{-\infty}^\infty e^{-x^2/2}\,dx=
  0+{1\over\sqrt{2\pi}}\sqrt{2\pi}=1.
$$
The standard deviation is then $\ds \sqrt{1}=1$.

Here is a simple example showing how these ideas can be
useful. Suppose it is known that, in the long run, 1 out of every 100
computer memory chips produced by a certain manufacturing plant is
defective when the manufacturing process is running correctly. Suppose
1000 chips are selected at random and 15 of them are defective. This
is more than the `expected' number (10), but is it so many that we
should suspect that something has gone wrong in the manufacturing
process? We are interested in the probability that various numbers of
defective chips arise; the probability distribution is discrete: there
can only be a whole number of defective chips. But (under reasonable
assumptions) the distribution is very close to a normal
distribution, namely this one:
$$
  f(x)={1\over\sqrt{2\pi}\sqrt{1000(.01)(.99)}}
   \exp\left({-(x-10)^2\over 2(1000)(.01)(.99)}\right),
$$
which is pictured in figure~\xrefn{fig:chip model} 
(recall that $\ds \exp(x)=e^x$).

Now how do we measure how unlikely it is that under normal
circumstances we would see 15 defective chips? We can't compute the
probability of exactly 15 defective chips, as this would be
$\ds\int_{15}^{15} f(x)\,dx = 0$. We could compute
$\ds\int_{14.5}^{15.5} f(x)\,dx \approx 0.036$; this means there is
only a $3.6\%$ chance that the number of defective chips is 15. (We
cannot compute these integrals exactly; computer software has been
used to approximate the integral values in this discussion.)
But
this is misleading:
$\ds\int_{9.5}^{10.5} f(x)\,dx \approx 0.126$, which is larger,
certainly, but still small, even for the ``most likely'' outcome. The
most useful question, in most circumstances, is this: how likely is it that
the number of defective chips is ``far from'' the mean? For example,
how likely, or unlikely, is it that the number of defective chips is
different by 5 or more from the expected value of 10? This is the
probability that the number of defective chips is less than 5 or
larger than 15, namely
$$
  \int_{-\infty}^{5} f(x)\,dx + \int_{15}^{\infty} f(x)\,dx \approx 0.11.
$$ 
So there is an $11\%$ chance that this happens---not large, but not
tiny. Hence the 15 defective chips does not appear to be cause for
alarm: about one time in nine we would expect to see the number of
defective chips 5 or more away from the expected 10. How about 20?
Here we compute
$$
  \int_{-\infty}^{0} f(x)\,dx + \int_{20}^{\infty} f(x)\,dx \approx 0.0015.
$$
So there is only a $0.15\%$ chance that the number of defective chips
is more than 10 away from the mean; this would typically be
interpreted as too suspicious to ignore---it shouldn't happen if the
process is running normally. 

The big question, of course, is what level of improbability should
trigger concern? It depends to some degree on the application, and in
particular on the consequences of getting it wrong in one direction or
the other. If we're wrong, do we lose a little money? A lot of money?
Do people die? In general, the standard choices are 5\% and 1\%. So
what we should do is find the number of defective chips that has only,
let us say, a 1\% chance of occurring under normal circumstances, and
use that as the relevant number. In other words, we want to know when
$$
  \int_{-\infty}^{10-r} f(x)\,dx + \int_{10+r}^{\infty} f(x)\,dx < 0.01.
$$ 
A bit of trial and error shows that with $r=8$ the value is about
$0.011$, and with $r=9$ it is about $0.004$, so if the number of
defective chips is 19 or more, or 1 or fewer, we should look for
problems. If the number is high, we worry that the manufacturing
process has a problem, or conceivably that the process that tests for
defective chips is not working correctly and is flagging good chips as
defective. If the number is too low, we suspect that the testing
procedure is broken, and is not detecting defective chips.
