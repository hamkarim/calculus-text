We have not yet verified the power rule, $\ds{d\over dx}x^a=ax^{a-1}$,
for non-integer $a$.
There is a close relationship between $\ds x^2$ and $\ds x^{1/2}$---these
functions are inverses of each other, each ``undoing'' what the other
has done. Not surprisingly, this means there is a relationship between
their derivatives.

Let's rewrite $\ds y=x^{1/2}$ as $\ds y^2 = x$.
We say that this equation
defines the function $\ds y=x^{1/2}$ 
implicitly\index{implicit function}\index{function!implicit}
because while it is not an explicit expression $y=\ldots$, it is true
that if $\ds x=y^2$ then $y$ is in fact the square root function.
Now, for the time being, pretend that all we know of $y$ is
that $\ds x=y^2$; what can we say about derivatives? We can take the
derivative of both sides of the equation:
$${d\over dx}x={d\over dx}y^2.$$
Then using the chain rule on the right hand side:
$$1 = 2y\left({d\over dx}y\right) = 2yy'.$$
Then we can solve for $y'$:
$$y'={1\over 2y} = {1\over 2x^{1/2}}={1\over2}x^{-1/2}.$$
This is the power rule for $\ds x^{1/2}$.

There is one little difficulty here. To use the chain rule to compute 
$\ds d/dx(y^2)=2yy'$ we need to know that the function $y$ {\em has\/} a
derivative. All we have shown is that {\em if\/} it has a derivative
then that derivative must be $\ds x^{-1/2}/2$. When using this method we will
always have to assume that the desired derivative exists, but
fortunately this is a safe assumption for most such problems. 

Here's another interesting feature of this calculation. The equation
$\ds x=y^2$ defines more than one function implicitly: $\ds y=-\sqrt{x}$ also
makes the equation true. Following exactly the calculation above we
arrive at
$$y'={1\over 2y} = {1\over 2(-x^{1/2})}=-{1\over2}x^{-1/2}.$$
So the single calculation leading to $y'=1/(2y)$ simultaneously
computes the derivatives of both functions.

We can use the same technique to verify the product rule for any
rational power. Suppose $\ds y=x^{m/n}$. Write instead $\ds x^m=y^n$ and take
the derivative of each side to get $\ds mx^{m-1}=ny^{n-1}y'$. Then 
$$y'={mx^{m-1}\over ny^{n-1}}={mx^{m-1}\over n(x^{m/n})^{n-1}}=
{m\over n}x^{m-1}x^{-m(n-1)/n}={m\over n}x^{m/n-1}.$$

This example involves an inverse function defined implicitly,
but other functions can be defined implicitly, and sometimes a single
equation can be used to implicitly define more than one
function. 
\elselatetranscendentals

As we have seen, there is a close relationship 
between the derivatives of $\ds e^x$ and $\ln x$ because these functions
are inverses. Rather than relying on pictures for our understanding,
we would like to be able to exploit this relationship
computationally.  In fact this technique can help us find derivatives
in many situations, not just when we seek the derivative of an inverse
function. 

We will begin by illustrating the technique to find what we already
know, the derivative of $\ln x$. Let's write $y=\ln x$ and then
$\ds x=e^{\ln x}=e^y$, that is, $\ds x=e^y$. We say that this equation
defines the function $y=\ln x$ 
implicitly\index{implicit function}\index{function!implicit}
because while it is not an explicit expression $y=\ldots$, it is true
that if $\ds x=e^y$ then $y$ is in fact the natural logarithm
function. Now, for the time being, pretend that all we know of $y$ is
that $\ds x=e^y$; what can we say about derivatives? We can take the
derivative of both sides of the equation:
$${d\over dx}x={d\over dx}e^y.$$
Then using the chain rule on the right hand side:
$$1 = \left({d\over dx}y\right) e^y = y'e^y.$$
Then we can solve for $y'$:
$$y'={1\over e^y} = {1\over x}.$$
There is one little difficulty here. To use the chain rule to compute 
$\ds d/dx(e^y)=y'e^y$ we need to know that the function $y$ {\em has\/} a
derivative. All we have shown is that {\em if\/} it has a derivative
then that derivative must be $1/x$. When using this method we will
always have to assume that the desired derivative exists, but
fortunately this is a safe assumption for most such problems. 

The example $y=\ln x$ involved an inverse function defined implicitly,
but other functions can be defined implicitly, and sometimes a single
equation can be used to implicitly define more than one
function. 
\filatetranscendentals Here's a familiar example. 
The equation $\ds r^2=x^2+y^2$
describes a circle of radius $r$. The circle is not a function
$y=f(x)$ because for some values of $x$ there are two corresponding
values of $y$. If we want to work with a function, we can break the
circle into two pieces, the upper and lower semicircles, each of which
is a function. Let's call these $y=U(x)$ and $y=L(x)$; in fact this is
a fairly simple example, and it's possible to give explicit
expressions for these: $\ds U(x)=\sqrt{r^2-x^2\ }$ and
$\ds L(x)=-\sqrt{r^2-x^2\ }$.  But it's somewhat easier, and quite useful,
to view both functions as given implicitly by $\ds r^2=x^2+y^2$: both
$\ds r^2=x^2+U(x)^2$ and $\ds r^2=x^2+L(x)^2$ are true, and we can think of 
$\ds r^2=x^2+y^2$ as defining both $U(x)$ and $L(x)$.

Now we can take the derivative of both sides as before, remembering
that $y$ is not simply a variable but a function---in this case, $y$
is either $U(x)$ or $L(x)$ but we're not yet specifying which one.
When we take the derivative we just have to remember to apply the
chain rule where $y$ appears.
$$
\eqalign{
{d\over dx}r^2&={d\over dx}(x^2+y^2)\cr
0&=2x+2yy'\cr
y'&={-2x\over 2y}=-{x\over y}\cr
}$$
Now we have an expression for $y'$, but it contains $y$ as well as
$x$. This means that if we want to compute $y'$ for some particular
value of $x$ we'll have to know or compute $y$ at that value of $x$ as
well. It is at this point that we will need to know whether $y$ is
$U(x)$ or $L(x)$. Occasionally it will turn out that we can avoid
explicit use of $U(x)$ or $L(x)$ by the nature of the problem

\example
Find the slope of the circle $\ds 4=x^2+y^2$ at the point
$\ds (1,-\sqrt{3})$. Since we know both the $x$ and $y$ coordinates of the
point of interest, we do not need to explicitly recognize that this
point is on $L(x)$, and we do not need to use $L(x)$ to compute
$y$---but we could. Using the calculation of $y'$ from above, 
$$y'=-{x\over y}=-{1\over -\sqrt{3}}={1\over \sqrt{3}}.$$
It is instructive to compare this approach to others.

We might have recognized at the start that $\ds (1,-\sqrt{3})$ is on the
function $\ds y=L(x)=-\sqrt{4-x^2}$. We could then take the derivative of
$L(x)$, using the power rule and the chain rule, to get
$$L'(x)=-{1\over 2}(4-x^2)^{-1/2}(-2x)={x\over\sqrt{4-x^2}}.$$
Then we could compute $\ds L'(1)=1/\sqrt{3}$ by substituting $x=1$.

Alternately, we could realize that the point is on $L(x)$, but use the
fact that $y'=-x/y$. Since the point is on $L(x)$ we can replace $y$
by $L(x)$ to get
$$y'=-{x\over L(x)}=-{x\over \sqrt{4-x^2}},$$
without computing the derivative of $L(x)$ explicitly. Then we
substitute $x=1$ and get the same answer as before.

In the case of the circle it is possible to find the functions $U(x)$
and $L(x)$ explicitly, but there are potential advantages to using
implicit differentiation anyway. In some cases it is more difficult or
impossible to find an explicit formula for $y$ and implicit
differentiation is the only way to find the derivative.

\iflatetranscendentals

\example
Find the derivative of any function defined implicitly by 
$\ds yx^2+y^2=x$. We treat $y$ as an unspecified function and use the
chain rule:
$$\eqalign{
{d\over dx}(yx^2+y^2)&={d\over dx}x\cr
(y\cdot 2x+y'\cdot x^2)+2yy'&=1\cr
y'\cdot x^2+2yy'&=-y\cdot 2x\cr
y'&={-2xy\over x^2+2y}\cr
}$$

You might think that the step in which we solve for $y'$ could
sometimes be difficult---after all, we're using implicit
differentiation here because we can't solve the equation
$\ds yx^2+e^y=x$ for $y$, so maybe after taking the derivative we get
something that is hard to solve for $y'$. In fact, {\em this never
  happens.} All occurrences $y'$ come from applying the chain rule,
and whenever the chain rule is used it deposits a single $y'$
multiplied by some other expression. So it will always be possible to
group the terms containing $y'$ together and factor out the $y'$, just
as in the previous example. If you ever get anything more difficult
you have made a mistake and should fix it before trying to continue.

It is sometimes the case that a situation leads naturally to an
equation that defines a function implicitly. 

\example Consider all the points $(x,y)$ that have the property that 
the distance from $(x,y)$ to $\ds (x_1,y_1)$ plus the distance 
from $(x,y)$ to $\ds (x_2,y_2)$ is $2a$ ($a$ is some constant). These
points form an ellipse, which like a circle is not a function but can
viewed as two functions pasted together. Because we know how to write
down the distance between two points, we can write down an implicit
equation for the ellipse:
$$\sqrt{(x-x_1)^2+(y-y_1)^2}+\sqrt{(x-x_2)^2+(y-y_2)^2}=2a.$$
Then we can use implicit differentiation to find the slope of the
ellipse at any point, though the computation is rather messy.

\example We have already justified the power\index{power rule} rule by
using the exponential function, but we could also do it for rational
exponents by using implicit differentiation.  Suppose that
$\ds y=x^{m/n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are positive integers. We can write
this implicitly as $\ds y^n=x^m$, then because we justified the power rule
for integers, we can take the derivative of each side:
$$\eqalign{
ny^{n-1}y' &= mx^{m-1}\cr
y'&= {m\over n}{x^{m-1}\over y^{n-1}}\cr
y'&= {m\over n}{x^{m-1}\over (x^{m/n})^{n-1}}\cr
y'&= {m\over n}x^{m-1-(m/n)(n-1)}\cr
y'&= {m\over n}x^{m-1-m+(m/n)}\cr
y'&= {m\over n}x^{(m/n)-1}\cr

Two curves are {\dfont orthogonal\/} if at each point of intersection,
the angle between their tangent lines is $\pi/2$. Two
families of curves, $\cal{A}$ and $\cal{B}$, are
{\dfont orthogonal trajectories} of each other if given any curve $C$
