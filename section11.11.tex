\section{Taylor's Theorem}{}{}
\nobreak
One of the most important uses of infinite series is the potential for
using an initial portion of the series for $f$ to approximate $f$. We
have seen, for example, that when we add up the first $n$ terms of an
alternating series with decreasing terms that the difference between
this and the true value is at most the size of the next term. A
similar result is true of many Taylor series.

\thm Suppose that $f$ is defined on some open interval $I$ around $a$ and
suppose $\ds f^{(N+1)}(x)$ exists on this interval. Then
for each $x\not=a$ in $I$ there is a value $z$ between
$x$ and $a$ so that
$$ 
  f(x) = \sum_{n=0}^N {f^{(n)}(a)\over n!}\,(x-a)^n + 
  {f^{(N+1)}(z)\over (N+1)!}(x-a)^{N+1}. 
$$ 
\endthm
\proof
The proof requires some cleverness to set up, but then the details are
quite elementary. We want to define a function $F(t)$. 
Start with the equation
$$F(t)=\sum_{n=0}^N{f^{(n)}(t)\over n!}\,(x-t)^n + B(x-t)^{N+1}.$$
Here we have replaced $a$ by $t$ in the first $N+1$ terms of the
Taylor series, and added a carefully chosen term on the end, with $B$
to be determined. Note that
we are temporarily keeping $x$ fixed, so the only variable in this
equation is $t$, and we will be interested
only in $t$ between $a$ and $x$. Now substitute $t=a$:
$$F(a)=\sum_{n=0}^N{f^{(n)}(a)\over n!}\,(x-a)^n + B(x-a)^{N+1}.$$
Set this equal to $f(x)$:
$$f(x)=\sum_{n=0}^N{f^{(n)}(a)\over n!}\,(x-a)^n + B(x-a)^{N+1}.$$
Since $x\not=a$, we can solve this for $B$, which is a
``constant''---it depends on $x$ and $a$ but those are temporarily 
fixed.  Now we
have defined a function $F(t)$ with the property that
$F(a)=f(x)$. Consider also $F(x)$: all terms with a positive power of
$(x-t)$ become zero when we substitute $x$ for $t$, so we are left
with $\ds F(x)=f^{(0)}(x)/0!=f(x)$. So $F(t)$ is a function with the same
value on the endpoints of the interval $[a,x]$. 
By Rolle's theorem (\xrefn{thm:rolle}), we
know that there is a value $z\in(a,x)$ such that $F'(z)=0$. Let's look
at $F'(t)$. Each term in $F(t)$, except the first term and the extra
term involving $B$, is a product, so to take the derivative we use the
product rule on each of these terms. It will help to write out the
first few terms of the definition:
$$\eqalign{
  F(t)=f(t)&+{f^{(1)}(t)\over 1!}(x-t)^1+{f^{(2)}(t)\over 2!}(x-t)^2+
  {f^{(3)}(t)\over 3!}(x-t)^3+\cdots\cr
  &+{f^{(N)}(t)\over N!}(x-t)^N+
  B(x-t)^{N+1}.\cr}
$$
Now take the derivative:
$$\eqalign{
  F'(t) = f'(t) &+ 
  \left({f^{(1)}(t)\over 1!}(x-t)^0(-1)+{f^{(2)}(t)\over
    1!}(x-t)^1\right)\cr
  &+\left({f^{(2)}(t)\over 1!}(x-t)^1(-1)+{f^{(3)}(t)\over
    2!}(x-t)^2\right)\cr
  &+\left({f^{(3)}(t)\over 2!}(x-t)^2(-1)+{f^{(4)}(t)\over
    3!}(x-t)^3\right)+\dots+\cr
  &+\left({f^{(N)}(t)\over (N-1)!}(x-t)^{N-1}(-1)+{f^{(N+1)}(t)\over
    N!}(x-t)^N\right)\cr
  &+B(N+1)(x-t)^N(-1).\cr}
$$
Now most of the terms in this expression cancel out,
leaving just
$$F'(t) = {f^{(N+1)}(t)\over N!}(x-t)^N+B(N+1)(x-t)^N(-1).$$
At some $z$, $F'(z)=0$ so
$$\eqalign{
  0&={f^{(N+1)}(z)\over N!}(x-z)^N+B(N+1)(x-z)^N(-1)\cr
  B(N+1)(x-z)^N&={f^{(N+1)}(z)\over N!}(x-z)^N\cr
  B&={f^{(N+1)}(z)\over (N+1)!}.\cr
}$$
Now we can write 
$$
  F(t)=\sum_{n=0}^N{f^{(n)}(t)\over n!}\,(x-t)^n + 
  {f^{(N+1)}(z)\over (N+1)!}(x-t)^{N+1}.
$$
Recalling that $F(a)=f(x)$ we get
$$
  f(x)=\sum_{n=0}^N{f^{(n)}(a)\over n!}\,(x-a)^n + 
  {f^{(N+1)}(z)\over (N+1)!}(x-a)^{N+1},
$$
which is what we wanted to show.
\endproof

It may not be immediately obvious that this is particularly useful;
let's look at some examples.

\example Find a polynomial approximation for $\sin x$ accurate to $\pm
0.005$. 

From Taylor's theorem:
$$
  \sin x= \sum_{n=0}^N{f^{(n)}(a)\over n!}\,(x-a)^n + 
  {f^{(N+1)}(z)\over (N+1)!}(x-a)^{N+1}.
$$
What can we say about the size of the term
$${f^{(N+1)}(z)\over (N+1)!}(x-a)^{N+1}?$$
Every derivative of $\sin x$ is $\pm\sin x$ or $\pm\cos x$, so
$\ds |f^{(N+1)}(z)|\le 1$. The factor $\ds (x-a)^{N+1}$ is a bit more
difficult, since $x-a$ could be quite large. Let's pick $a=0$ and
$|x|\le\pi/2$; if we can compute $\sin x$ for $x\in[-\pi/2,\pi/2]$, we
can of course compute $\sin x$ for all $x$.

We need to pick $N$ so that 
$$\left|{x^{N+1}\over (N+1)!}\right|< 0.005.$$
Since we have limited $x$ to $[-\pi/2,\pi/2]$,
$$\left|{x^{N+1}\over (N+1)!}\right|<{2^{N+1}\over (N+1)!}.$$
The quantity on the right decreases with increasing $N$, so all we
need to do is find an $N$ so that 
$${2^{N+1}\over (N+1)!}<0.005.$$
A little trial and error shows that $N=8$ works, 
and in fact $\ds 2^{9}/9!<0.0015$, so 
$$\eqalign{
  \sin x &=\sum_{n=0}^8{f^{(n)}(0)\over n!}\,x^n \pm 0.0015\cr
  &=x-{x^3\over 6}+{x^5\over 120}-{x^7\over 5040}\pm 0.0015.\cr
}$$
Figure~\xrefn{fig:sine approximation} shows the graphs of $\sin x$ and
and the approximation on $[0,3\pi/2]$. As $x$ gets larger, the
approximation heads to negative infinity very quickly, since it is
essentially acting like $\ds -x^7$.

We can extract a bit more information from this example. If we do not
limit the value of $x$, we still have 
$$
  \left|{f^{(N+1)}(z)\over (N+1)!}x^{N+1}\right|\le 
  \left|{x^{N+1}\over (N+1)!}\right|
$$
so that $\sin x$ is represented by 
$$
  \sum_{n=0}^N{f^{(n)}(0)\over n!}\,x^n \pm 
  \left|{x^{N+1}\over (N+1)!}\right|.
$$
If we can show that 
$$
  \lim_{N\to\infty} \left|{x^{N+1}\over (N+1)!}\right|=0
$$
for each $x$ then 
$$
  \sin x=\sum_{n=0}^\infty{f^{(n)}(0)\over n!}\,x^n
  = \sum_{n=0}^\infty (-1)^n{x^{2n+1}\over (2n+1)!},
$$
that is, the sine function is actually equal to its
Maclaurin series for all $x$. How can we prove that the limit is zero?
Suppose that $N$ is larger than $|x|$, and let $M$ be the largest
integer less than $|x|$ (if $M=0$ the following is even easier). Then
$$
  \eqalign{
  {|x^{N+1}|\over (N+1)!} &= {|x|\over N+1}{|x|\over N}{|x|\over N-1}\cdots
    {|x|\over M+1}{|x|\over M}{|x|\over M-1}\cdots {|x|\over 2}{|x|\over 1}\cr
  &\le {|x|\over N+1}\cdot 1\cdot 1\cdots 1\cdot
    {|x|\over M}{|x|\over M-1}\cdots {|x|\over 2}{|x|\over 1}\cr
  &={|x|\over N+1}{|x|^M\over M!}.
  }
$$
The quantity $|x|^M/ M!$ is a constant, so 
$$
  \lim_{N\to\infty} {|x|\over N+1}{|x|^M\over M!} = 0
$$
and by the Squeeze Theorem (\xrefn{thm:squeeze theorem for sequences})
$$
  \lim_{N\to\infty} \left|{x^{N+1}\over (N+1)!}\right|=0
$$
as desired. Essentially the same argument works for $\cos x$ and $\ds
e^x$; unfortunately, it is more difficult to show that most functions
are equal to their Maclaurin series.

\example Find a polynomial approximation for $\ds e^x$ near $x=2$
accurate to $\pm
0.005$. 

From Taylor's theorem:
$$
  e^x= \sum_{n=0}^N{e^2\over n!}\,(x-2)^n + 
  {e^z\over (N+1)!}(x-2)^{N+1},
$$
since $\ds f^{(n)}(x)=e^x$ for all $n$. We are interested in $x$ near 2,
and we need to keep $\ds |(x-2)^{N+1}|$ in check, so we may as well
specify that $|x-2|\le 1$, so $x\in[1,3]$. Also
$$\left|{e^z\over (N+1)!}\right|\le {e^3\over (N+1)!},$$
so we need to find an $N$ that makes $\ds e^3/(N+1)!\le 0.005$. This time
$N=5$ makes $\ds e^3/(N+1)!< 0.0015$, so the approximating polynomial is
$$
  e^x=e^2+e^2(x-2)+{e^2\over2}(x-2)^2+{e^2\over6}(x-2)^3+
  {e^2\over24}(x-2)^4+{e^2\over120}(x-2)^5
  \pm 0.0015.
$$
This presents an additional problem for approximation, since we also
need to approximate $\ds e^2$, and any approximation we use will increase
the error, but we will not pursue this complication.

Note well that in these examples we found polynomials of a certain
accuracy only on a small interval, even though the series for $\sin x$
and $\ds e^x$ converge for all $x$; this is typical. To get the same
accuracy on a larger interval would require more terms.
