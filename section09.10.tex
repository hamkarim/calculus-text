Another geometric question that arises naturally is: ``What is the
surface area of a volume?'' For example, what is the surface area of a
sphere? More advanced techniques are required to approach this
question in general, but we can compute the areas of some volumes
generated by revolution.

As usual, the question is: how might we approximate the surface area?
For a surface obtained by rotating a curve around an axis, we can take
a polygonal approximation to the curve, as in the last section, and
rotate it around the same axis. This gives a surface composed of many
``truncated cones;'' a truncated cone is called a {\dfont
  frustum\index{frustum}\/} of a cone. Figure~\xrefn{fig:approximating
  surface area} illustrates this approximation.

So we need to be able to compute the area of a frustum of a cone.
Since the frustum can be formed by removing a small cone from the top
of a larger one, we can compute the desired area if we know the
surface area of a cone.
Suppose a right circular cone has base radius $r$ and slant height
$h$. If we cut the cone from the vertex to the base circle and
flatten it out, we obtain a sector of a circle with radius $h$ and arc
length $2\pi r$, as in figure~\xrefn{fig:area of cone}. The angle at
the center, in radians, is then $2\pi r/h$, and the area of the cone
is equal to the area of the sector of the circle. Let $A$ be the area
of the sector; since the area of the entire circle is $\ds \pi h^2$, we
have
$$
  \eqalign{{A\over\pi h^2}&={2\pi r/h\over 2\pi}\cr
  A &= \pi r h.\cr}
$$

Now suppose we have a frustum of a cone with slant height $h$ and
radii $\ds r_0$ and $\ds r_1$, as in figure~\xrefn{fig:frustum}. The area of
the entire cone is $\ds \pi r_1(h_0+h)$, and the area of the small cone is
$\ds \pi r_0 h_0$; thus, the area of the frustum is $\ds \pi r_1(h_0+h)-\pi
r_0 h_0=\pi((r_1-r_0)h_0+r_1h)$. By similar triangles, 
$${h_0\over r_0}={h_0+h\over r_1}.$$
With a bit of algebra this becomes $\ds (r_1-r_0)h_0= r_0h$; substitution
into the area gives
$$
  \pi((r_1-r_0)h_0+r_1h)=\pi(r_0h+r_1h)=\pi h(r_0+r_1)=2\pi
  {r_0+r_1\over2} h = 2\pi r h.
$$
The final form is particularly easy to remember, with $r$ equal to the
average of $\ds r_0$ and $\ds r_1$, as it is also the formula for the area of
a cylinder. (Think of a cylinder of radius $r$ and height $h$ as the
frustum of a cone of infinite height.)

Now we are ready to approximate the area of a surface of
revolution. On one subinterval, the situation is as shown in
figure~\xrefn{fig:surface subinterval}. When the line joining two
points on the curve is rotated around the $x$-axis, it forms a frustum
of a cone. The area is
$$
  2\pi r h= 2\pi {f(x_i)+f(x_{i+1})\over2}
    \sqrt{1+(f'(t_i))^2}\,\Delta x.
$$
Here
$\ds \sqrt{1+(f'(t_i))^2}\,\Delta x$ is the length of the line segment, 
as we found in the previous section. Assuming $f$ is a continuous
function, there must be some $\ds x_i^*$ in $\ds [x_i,x_{i+1}]$
such that
$\ds (f(x_i)+f(x_{i+1}))/2 = f(x_i^*)$, so
the approximation for the
surface area is
$$\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} 2\pi f(x_i^*)\sqrt{1+(f'(t_i))^2}\,\Delta x.$$
This is not quite the sort of sum we have seen before, as it contains
two different values in the interval $\ds [x_i,x_{i+1}]$, namely
$\ds x_i^*$ and $\ds t_i$. Nevertheless, using more advanced techniques
than we have available here, it turns out that
$$\lim_{n\to\infty} 
\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} 2\pi f(x_i^*)\sqrt{1+(f'(t_i))^2}\,\Delta x=
\int_a^b 2\pi f(x)\sqrt{1+(f'(x))^2}\,dx$$ 
is the surface area we seek. (Roughly speaking, this is because while
$\ds x_i^*$ and $\ds t_i$ are distinct values in $\ds[x_i,x_{i+1}]$,
they get closer and closer to each other as the length of the interval
shrinks.)

\example We compute the surface area of a sphere of radius $r$.
The sphere can be obtained by rotating the graph of
  $\ds f(x)=\sqrt{r^2 - x^2}$ about the $x$-axis.
The derivative $f'$ is $\ds -x/\sqrt{r^2-x^2}$, so the surface area is
given by
$$\eqalign{
A&=2\pi \int_{-r }^r \sqrt{r^2 - x^2}\sqrt{1+{x^2\over r^2-x^2}}\,dx\cr
&=2\pi \int_{-r }^r \sqrt{r^2 - x^2}\sqrt{r^2\over r^2-x^2}\,dx\cr
&=2\pi \int_{-r }^r r\,dx=2\pi r\int_{-r }^r 1\,dx=4\pi r^2\cr}$$

If the curve is rotated around the $y$ axis, the formula is nearly
identical, because the length of the line segment we use to
approximate a portion of the curve doesn't change. Instead of the
radius $\ds f(x_i^*)$, we use the new radius $\ds \bar x_i=
(x_i+x_{i+1})/2$, and the surface area integral becomes
$$\int_a^b 2\pi x\sqrt{1+(f'(x))^2}\,dx.$$

Compute the area of the surface formed when $\ds f(x)
=x^2$ between $0$ and $2$ is rotated around the $y$-axis.

We compute $f'(x)= 2x$, and then
$$2\pi\int_0^2 x\sqrt{1+4x^2}\,dx={\pi\over6}(17^{3/2}-1),$$
by a simple substitution.
