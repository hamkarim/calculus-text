\secrdef{sec:Double Integrals in Cylindrical Coordinates}
\nobreak
Suppose we have a surface given in cylindrical coordinates as
$z=f(r,\theta)$ and we wish to find the integral over some region. We
could attempt to translate into rectangular coordinates and do the
integration there, but it is often easier to stay in cylindrical
coordinates.

How might we approximate the volume under such a surface in a way that
uses cylindrical coordinates directly? The basic idea is the same as
before: we divide the region into many small regions, multiply the
area of each small region by the height of the surface somewhere in
that little region, and add them up. What changes is the shape of the
small regions; in order to have a nice representation in terms of $r$
and $\theta$, we use small pieces of ring-shaped areas, as shown in
figure~\xrefn{fig:cylindrical coordinates regions}. Each small region
is roughly rectangular, except that two sides are segments of a circle
and the other two sides are not quite parallel. Near a point
$(r,\theta)$, the length of either circular arc is about
$r\Delta\theta$ and the length of each straight side is simply $\Delta
r$. When $\Delta r$ and $\Delta \theta$ are very small, the region is
nearly a rectangle with area $r\Delta r\Delta\theta$, and the volume
under the surface is approximately
$$\sum\sum f(r_i,\theta_j)r_i\Delta r\Delta\theta.$$
In the limit, this turns into a double integral
$$\int_{\theta_0}^{\theta_1}\int_{r_0}^{r_1} f(r,\theta)r\,dr\,d\theta.$$

\example Find the volume under $z=\sqrt{4-r^2}$ 
above the quarter circle bounded by
the two axes and the circle $x^2+y^2=4$ in the first quadrant.

In terms of $r$ and $\theta$, this region is described by the
restrictions $0\le r\le 2$ and $0\le\theta\le\pi/2$, so we have
$$\eqalign{
\int_{0}^{\pi/2}\int_{0}^{2} \sqrt{4-r^2}\;r\,dr\,d\theta
&=\int_{0}^{\pi/2}\left. -{1\over3}(4-r^2)^{3/2}\right|_0^2\,d\theta\cr
&=\int_{0}^{\pi/2} {8\over3}\,d\theta\cr
&={4\pi\over3}.\cr
}$$
The surface is a portion of the sphere of radius 2 centered at the
origin, in fact exactly one-eighth of the sphere. We know the formula
for volume of a sphere is $(4/3)\pi r^3$, so the volume we have
computed is $(1/8)(4/3)\pi 2^3=(4/3)\pi$, in agreement with our
answer.

This example is much like a simple one in rectangular coordinates: the region
of interest may be described exactly by a constant range for
each of the variables. As with rectangular coordinates, we can adapt
the method to deal with more complicated regions.

\example Find the volume under $z=\sqrt{4-r^2}$ above the region enclosed by the
curve $r=2\cos\theta$, $-\pi/2\le\theta\le\pi/2$; see
figure~\xrefn{fig:volume with variable limits}.
The region is described in polar coordinates by the inequalities
$-\pi/2\le\theta\le\pi/2$ and $0\le r\le2\cos\theta$, so
the double integral is
$$
\int_{-\pi/2}^{\pi/2}\int_{0}^{2\cos\theta} \sqrt{4-r^2}\;r\,dr\,d\theta
=2\int_{0}^{\pi/2}\int_{0}^{2\cos\theta} \sqrt{4-r^2}\;r\,dr\,d\theta.
$$
We can rewrite the integral as shown because of the symmetry of the
volume; this avoids a complication during the evaluation.
Proceeding:
$$\eqalign{
2\int_{0}^{\pi/2}\int_{0}^{2\cos\theta} \sqrt{4-r^2}\;r\,dr\,d\theta
&=2\int_{0}^{\pi/2}-{1\over3}\left.(4-r^2)^{3/2}\right|_0^{2\cos\theta}\,d\theta\cr
&=2\int_{0}^{\pi/2}-{8\over3}\sin^3\theta+{8\over3}\,d\theta\cr
&=\left.2\left(-{8\over3}{\cos^3\theta\over3}-\cos\theta+{8\over3}\theta\right)\right|_0^{\pi/2}\cr
&={8\over3}\pi-{32\over9}.\cr
}$$

You might have learned a formula for computing areas in polar
coordinates. It is possible to
compute areas as volumes, so that you need only remember one
technique. Consider the surface $z=1$, a horizontal plane. The volume
under this surface and above a region in the $x$-$y$ plane is 
simply $1\cdot(\hbox{area of the region})$, so computing the volume
really just computes the area of the region.

\example Find the area outside the circle $r=2$ and inside
$r=4\sin\theta$; see figure~\xrefn{fig:area by volume}.
The region is described by $\pi/6\le\theta\le5\pi/6$ and
$2\le r\le4\sin\theta$, so the integral is
$$\eqalign{
\int_{\pi/6}^{5\pi/6}\int_2^{4\sin\theta}1\,r\,dr\,d\theta
&=\int_{\pi/6}^{5\pi/6}\left. {1\over2}r^2\right|_2^{4\sin\theta}\,d\theta\cr
&=\int_{\pi/6}^{5\pi/6}8\sin^2\theta-2\,d\theta\cr
&={4\over3}\pi+2\sqrt3.\cr
}$$
