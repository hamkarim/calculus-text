\section{The Divergence Theorem}{}{}
\nobreak
The third version of Green's Theorem (equation~\xrefn{eq:greens
  theorem third form}) we saw was:
$$\int_{\partial D} {\bf F}\cdot{\bf N}\,ds=\dint{D} \nabla\cdot{\bf
  F}\,dA.$$ With minor changes this turns into another equation, the
Divergence Theorem\index{Divergence Theorem}:
\thm (Divergence Theorem) Under suitable conditions, if $E$ is a
region of three dimensional space and $D$ is its boundary surface,
oriented outward, then
$$\dint{D} {\bf F}\cdot{\bf N}\,dS=\tint{E} \nabla\cdot{\bf
  F}\,dV.$$
\endthm

%\detachedproof{Proof of the Divergence Theorem.}
\proof Again this theorem is too difficult to prove here, but a special case
is easier. In the proof of a special case of Green's Theorem, we
needed to know that we could describe the region of integration in
both possible orders, so that we could set up one double integral
using $dx\,dy$ and another using $dy\,dx$. Similarly here, we need to
be able to describe the three-dimensional region $E$ in different
ways.

We start by rewriting the triple integral:
$$\tint{E} \nabla\cdot{\bf
  F}\,dV = \tint{E} (P_x+Q_y+R_z)\,dV
=\tint{E} P_x\,dV + \tint{E} Q_y\,dV + \tint{E} R_z\,dV.$$
The double integral may be rewritten:
$$\dint{D} {\bf F}\cdot{\bf N}\,dS
=\dint{D} (P{\bf i}+Q{\bf j}+R{\bf k})\cdot{\bf N}\,dS
=\dint{D} P{\bf i}\cdot{\bf N}\,dS+\dint{D} Q{\bf j}\cdot{\bf N}\,dS+
\dint{D} R{\bf k}\cdot{\bf N}\,dS.$$
To prove that these give the same value it is sufficient to prove that
$$\eqalignno{
\dint{D} P{\bf i}\cdot{\bf N}\,dS&=\tint{E} P_x\,dV,\cr
\dint{D} Q{\bf j}\cdot{\bf N}\,dS&=\tint{E} Q_y\,dV,\;\hbox{and}&
\eqrdef{eq:divergence proof}(\xrefn{eq:divergence proof})\cr
\dint{D} R{\bf k}\cdot{\bf N}\,dS&=\tint{E} R_z\,dV.\cr
}$$
% $$
% \dint{D} P{\bf i}\cdot{\bf N}\,dS=\tint{E} P_x\,dV,\;
% \dint{D} Q{\bf j}\cdot{\bf N}\,dS=\tint{E} Q_y\,dV,\;\hbox{and}\;
% \dint{D} R{\bf k}\cdot{\bf N}\,dS=\tint{E} R_z\,dV.$$
Not surprisingly, these are all pretty much the same; we'll do the
first one.

We set the triple integral up with $dx$ innermost:
$$\tint{E} P_x\,dV=\dint{B}\int_{g_1(y,z)}^{g_2(y,z)} P_x\,dx\,dA=
\dint{B} P(g_2(y,z),y,z)-P(g_1(y,z),y,z)\,dA,$$
where $B$ is the region in the $y$-$z$ plane over which we integrate.
The boundary surface of $E$ consists of a ``top'' $x=g_2(y,z)$, a
``bottom'' $x=g_1(y,z)$, and a ``wrap-around side'' that is vertical
to the $y$-$z$ plane. To integrate over the entire boundary surface,
we can integrate over each of these (top, bottom, side) and add the
results. Over the side surface, the vector $\bf N$ is perpendicular to
the vector $\bf i$, so
\texonly
$$
\dint{\hbox{\sevenpoint side}} P{\bf i}\cdot{\bf N}\,dS = 
\dint{\hbox{\sevenpoint side}}
0\,dS=0.$$
\endtexonly
\htmlonly
$$
\dint{\sevenpoint \hbox{side}} P{\bf i}\cdot{\bf N}\,dS = 
\dint{\sevenpoint \hbox{side}}
0\,dS=0.$$
\endhtmlonly
Thus, we are left with just the surface integral over the top plus the
surface integral over the bottom. For the top, we use the vector
function
${\bf r}=\langle g_2(y,z),y,z\rangle$ which gives 
${\bf r}_y\times{\bf r}_z=\langle 1,-g_{2y},-g_{2z}\rangle$; the dot
product of this with ${\bf i}=\langle 1,0,0\rangle$ is 1. Then
\texonly
$$
\dint{\hbox{\sevenpoint top}} P{\bf i}\cdot{\bf N}\,dS
=\dint{B} P(g_2(y,z),y,z)\,dA.$$
\endtexonly
\htmlonly
$$
\dint{\sevenpoint \hbox{top}} P{\bf i}\cdot{\bf N}\,dS
=\dint{B} P(g_2(y,z),y,z)\,dA.$$
\endhtmlonly
In almost identical fashion we get
\texonly
$$
\dint{\hbox{\sevenpoint bottom}} P{\bf i}\cdot{\bf N}\,dS
=-\dint{B} P(g_1(y,z),y,z)\,dA,$$
\endtexonly
\htmlonly
$$
\dint{\sevenpoint \hbox{bottom}} P{\bf i}\cdot{\bf N}\,dS
=-\dint{B} P(g_1(y,z),y,z)\,dA,$$
\endhtmlonly
where the negative sign is needed to make $\bf N$ point in the
negative $x$ direction. Now
$$\dint{D} P{\bf i}\cdot{\bf N}\,dS
=\dint{B} P(g_2(y,z),y,z)\,dA-\dint{B}
    P(g_1(y,z),y,z)\,dA,$$ which is the same as the value of the
    triple integral above.
\endproof

\example Let ${\bf F}=\langle 2x,3y,z^2\rangle$, and consider the
three-dimensional volume inside the cube with faces parallel to the
principal planes and opposite corners at
$(0,0,0)$ and $(1,1,1)$. We compute the two integrals of the
divergence theorem.

The triple integral is the easier of the two:
$$\int_0^1\int_0^1\int_0^1 2+3+2z\,dx\,dy\,dz=6.$$
The surface integral must be separated into six parts, one for each
face of the cube. One face is $z=0$ or ${\bf r}=\langle u,v,0\rangle$, $0\le
u,v\le 1$. Then ${\bf r}_u=\langle 1,0,0\rangle$, 
${\bf r}_v=\langle 0,1,0\rangle$, and ${\bf r}_u\times{\bf r}_v=
\langle 0,0,1\rangle$. We need this to be oriented downward (out of
the cube), so we use
$\langle 0,0,-1\rangle$ and the corresponding integral is
$$\int_0^1\int_0^1 -z^2\,du\,dv=\int_0^1\int_0^1 0\,du\,dv=0.$$

Another face is $y=1$ or ${\bf r}=\langle u,1,v\rangle$. Then ${\bf
  r}_u=\langle 1,0,0\rangle$, ${\bf r}_v=\langle 0,0,1\rangle$, and
${\bf r}_u\times{\bf r}_v= \langle 0,-1,0\rangle$. We need a normal in
the positive $y$ direction, so we convert this to $\langle
0,1,0\rangle$, and the corresponding integral is
$$\int_0^1\int_0^1 3y\,du\,dv=\int_0^1\int_0^1 3\,du\,dv=3.$$

The remaining four integrals have values 0, 0, 2, and 1, and the sum
of these is 6, in agreement with the triple integral.

\example Let ${\bf F}=\langle x^3,y^3,z^2\rangle$, and consider the
cylindrical volume $x^2+y^2\le9$, $0\le z\le2$.
The triple integral (using cylindrical coordinates) is 
$$\int_0^{2\pi}\int_0^3\int_0^2 (3r^2+2z)r\,dz\,dr\,d\theta=279\pi.$$

For the surface we need three integrals. The top of the cylinder can
be represented by
${\bf r}=\langle v\cos u,v\sin u,2\rangle$; 
${\bf r}_u\times{\bf r}_v=\langle 0,0,-v\rangle$, which points down
into the cylinder,
so we convert it to $\langle 0,0,v\rangle$. Then
$$\int_0^{2\pi}\int_0^3 \langle v^3\cos^3u,v^3\sin^3u,4\rangle\cdot
\langle 0,0,v\rangle\,dv\,du=
\int_0^{2\pi}\int_0^3 4v\,dv\,du=36\pi.$$
The bottom is 
${\bf r}=\langle v\cos u,v\sin u,0\rangle$; 
${\bf r}_u\times{\bf r}_v=\langle 0,0,-v\rangle$ and
$$\int_0^{2\pi}\int_0^3 \langle v^3\cos^3u,v^3\sin^3u,0\rangle\cdot
\langle 0,0,-v\rangle\,dv\,du=
\int_0^{2\pi}\int_0^3 0\,dv\,du=0.$$
The side of the cylinder is ${\bf r}=\langle 3\cos u,3\sin u,v\rangle$;
${\bf r}_u\times{\bf r}_v=\langle 3\cos u,3\sin u,0\rangle$ which does
point outward, so
$$\eqalign{
\int_0^{2\pi}\int_0^2 &\langle 27\cos^3 u,27\sin^3 u,v^2\rangle\cdot
\langle 3\cos u,3\sin u,0\rangle \,dv\,du\cr
&=\int_0^{2\pi}\int_0^2 81\cos^4 u+81\sin^4u\,dv\,du=243\pi.\cr}$$
The total surface integral is thus $36\pi+0+243\pi=279\pi$.
