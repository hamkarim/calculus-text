We have seen how to compute certain areas by using integration; some
volumes may also be computed by evaluating an integral. Generally, the
volumes that we can compute this way have cross-sections that are easy
to describe.

\example
Find the volume of a pyramid with a square base that is 20 meters tall
and 20 meters on a side at the base. As with most of our applications
of integration, we begin by asking how we might approximate the
volume. Since we can easily compute the volume of a rectangular prism
(that is, a ``box''), we will use some boxes to approximate the volume of
the pyramid, as shown in figure~\xrefn{fig:pyramid}: on the left is a
cross-sectional view, on the right is a 3D view of part of the pyramid
with some of the boxes used to approximate the volume.

Each box has volume of the form $\ds (2x_i)(2x_i)\Delta y$. Unfortunately,
there are two variables here; fortunately, we can write $x$ in terms
of $y$: $x=10-y/2$ or $\ds x_i=10-y_i/2$. Then the total volume is
approximately
$$\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} 4(10-y_i/2)^2\Delta y$$
and in the limit we get the volume as the value of an integral:
$$
  \int_0^{20} 4(10-y/2)^2\,dy=\int_0^{20} (20-y)^2\,dy=
  \left.-{(20-y)^3\over3}\right|_0^{20}=
  -{0^3\over3}--{20^3\over3}={8000\over3}.
$$
As you may know, the volume of a pyramid is 
$(1/3)(\hbox{height})(\hbox{area of base})=(1/3)(20)(400)$, which
agrees with our answer.

A cross-section at a value $\ds x_i$ on the $x$-axis is a triangle with
base $\ds 2(1-x_i^2)$ and height $\ds \sqrt3(1-x_i^2)$, so the area of the
cross-section is 
$$
  {1\over2}(\hbox{base})(\hbox{height})=
  (1-x_i^2)\sqrt3(1-x_i^2),
$$
and the volume of a thin ``slab'' is then
$$(1-x_i^2)\sqrt3(1-x_i^2)\Delta x.$$
Thus the total volume is 
$$\int_{-1}^1 \sqrt3(1-x^2)^2\,dx={16\over15}\sqrt3.$$
\vskip-10pt\endexample

One easy way to get ``nice'' cross-sections is by rotating a plane
figure around a line. For example, in figure~\xrefn{fig:solid of
  rotation} we see a plane region under a curve and between two
vertical lines; then the result of rotating this around the $\ds
x$-axis, and
a typical circular cross-section.

Of course a real ``slice'' of this figure will not have straight
sides, but we can approximate the volume of the slice by a cylinder or
disk with circular top and bottom and straight sides; the volume of
this disk will have the form $\ds \pi r^2\Delta x$. As long as we can
write $r$ in terms of $x$ we can compute the volume by an integral.

\example
Find the volume of a right circular cone with base radius 10 and
height 20. (A right circular cone is one with a circular base and with
the tip of the cone directly over the center of the base.)
We can view this cone as produced by the rotation of the line
$y=x/2$ rotated about the $x$-axis, as indicated in
figure~\xrefn{fig:line to cone}.

At a particular point on the $x$-axis, say $\ds x_i$, the radius of the
resulting cone is the $y$-coordinate of the corresponding point on the
line, namely $\ds y_i=x_i/2$. Thus the total volume is approximately
$$\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} \pi (x_i/2)^2\,dx$$
and the exact volume is
$$
  \int_0^{20} \pi
  {x^2\over4}\,dx={\pi\over4}{20^3\over3}={2000\pi\over3}.
$$ 
Note that we can instead do the calculation with a generic height and
radius: 
$$
  \int_0^{h} \pi{r^2\over h^2}x^2\,dx
  ={\pi r^2\over h^2}{h^3\over3}={\pi r^2h\over3},
$$ 
giving us the usual formula for the volume of a cone.

\example
Find the volume of the object generated when the area between
$\ds y=x^2$ and $y=x$ is rotated around the $x$-axis. This solid has a
``hole'' in the middle; we can compute the volume by subtracting the
volume of the hole from the volume enclosed by the outer surface of
the solid. In figure~\xrefn{fig:solid with hole} we show the region
that is rotated, the resulting solid with the front half cut away,
the cone that forms the outer surface, the
horn-shaped hole, and a cross-section perpendicular to the $x$-axis.

We have already computed the volume of a cone; in this case it is
$\pi/3$. At a particular value of $x$, say $\ds x_i$, the cross-section of
the horn is a circle with radius $\ds x_i^2$, so the volume of the horn is
$$\int_0^1 \pi(x^2)^2\,dx=\int_0^1 \pi x^4\,dx=\pi{1\over 5},$$
so the desired volume is $\pi/3-\pi/5=2\pi/15$.

As with the area between curves, there is an alternate approach that
computes the desired volume ``all at once'' by approximating the
volume of the actual solid. We can approximate the volume of a slice
of the solid with a washer-shaped volume, as indicated in
figure~\xrefn{fig:solid with hole}.
%{fig:washer}.

The volume of such a washer is the area of the face times the
thickness. The thickness, as usual, is $\Delta x$, while the area of
the face is the area of the outer circle minus the area of the inner
circle, say $\ds \pi R^2-\pi r^2$. In the present example, at a particular $\ds x_i$,
the radius $R$ is $\ds x_i$ and $r$ is $\ds x_i^2$. Hence, the whole volume is
$$
  \int_0^1 \pi x^2-\pi x^4\,dx=
  \left.\pi\left({x^3\over3}-{x^5\over5}\right)\right|_0^1=
  \pi\left({1\over3}-{1\over5}\right)={2\pi\over15}.
$$
Of course, what we have done here is exactly the same calculation as
before, except we have in effect recomputed the volume of the outer cone.
\endexample

Suppose the region between $f(x)=x+1$ and $\ds g(x)=(x-1)^2$ is rotated around
the $y$-axis; see figure~\xrefn{fig:shell method}. It is possible, but
inconvenient, to compute the  volume of the resulting solid by the
method we have used so far. The problem is that there are two
``kinds'' of typical rectangles: those that go from the line to the
parabola and those that touch the parabola on both ends. To compute
the volume using this approach, we need to break the problem into two
parts and compute two integrals:
$$
  \pi\int_0^1 (1+\sqrt{y})^2-(1-\sqrt{y})^2\,dy+
  \pi\int_1^4  (1+\sqrt{y})^2-(y-1)^2\,dy={8\over3}\pi + {65\over6}\pi
  ={27\over2}\pi.
$$
If instead we consider a typical vertical rectangle, {but still rotate
  around the $y$-axis,} we get a thin ``shell'' instead of a thin
``washer''. If we add up the volume of such thin shells we will get an
approximation to the true volume. What is the volume of such a shell?
Consider the shell at $\ds x_i$.
Imagine that we cut the shell vertically in one place and ``unroll''
it into a thin, flat sheet. This sheet will be almost a rectangular
prism that is $\Delta x$ thick, $\ds f(x_i)-g(x_i)$ tall, and $\ds 2\pi x_i$
wide (namely, the circumference of the shell before it was unrolled).
The volume will then be approximately the volume of a rectangular
prism with these dimensions: $\ds 2\pi x_i(f(x_i)-g(x_i))\Delta x$. If we
add these up and take the limit as usual, we get the integral
$$
  \int_0^3 2\pi x(f(x)-g(x))\,dx=
  \int_0^3 2\pi x(x+1-(x-1)^2)\,dx={27\over2}\pi.
$$
Not only does this accomplish the task with only one integral, the
integral is somewhat easier than those in the previous
calculation. Things are not always so neat, but it is often the case
that one of the two methods will be simpler than the other, so it is
worth considering both before starting to do calculations.

called {\dfont ellipsoids\/}; one is vaguely rugby-ball shaped, one is
sort of flying-saucer shaped, or perhaps squished-beach-ball-shaped.

\exercise Use integration to compute the volume of a sphere of radius
$r$. You should of course get the well-known formula $\ds 4\pi r^3/3$.

\exercise The base of a tetrahedron (a triangular pyramid) of height $h$
is an equilateral triangle of side $s$.  Its cross-sections
perpendicular to an altitude are equilateral triangles.  Express its
volume $V$ as an integral, and find a formula for $V$ in terms of $h$
and $s$. Verify that your answer is $(1/3)(\hbox{area of
  base})(\hbox{height})$.

\exercise
The base of a solid is the region between $f(x)=\cos x$ and
$g(x)=-\cos x$, $-\pi/2\le x\le\pi/2$,
and its cross-sections perpendicular to the $x$-axis 
are squares.
Find the volume of the solid.
