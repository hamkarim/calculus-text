We have already seen how to compute slopes of curves given by
parametric equations---it is how we computed slopes in polar
coordinates.

\example Find the slope of the cycloid $x=t-\sin t$, $y=1-\cos t$.
We compute $x'=1-\cos t$, $y'=\sin t$, so 
$${dy\over dx} ={\sin t\over  1-\cos t}.$$
Note that when $t$ is an odd multiple of $\pi$, like $\pi$ or $3\pi$,
this is $(0/2)=0$, so there is a horizontal tangent line, in agreement
with figure~\xrefn{fig:cycloid}. At even multiples of $\pi$, the
fraction is $0/0$, which is undefined. The figure shows that
there is no tangent line at such points.

Areas can be a bit trickier with parametric equations, depending on
the curve and the area desired. We can potentially compute areas
between the curve and the $x$-axis quite easily.

\example Find the area under one arch of the cycloid
$x=t-\sin t$, $y=1-\cos t$. We would like to compute
$$\int_0^{2\pi} y\;dx,$$
but we do not know $y$ in terms of $x$. However, the parametric
equations allow us to make a substitution: use $y=1-\cos t$
to replace $y$, and compute $dx=(1-\cos t)\;dt$. Then the integral
becomes 
$$\int_0^{2\pi} (1-\cos t)(1-\cos t)\;dt=3\pi.$$
Note that we need to convert the original $x$ limits to $t$ limits
using $x=t-\sin t$. When $x=0$, $t=\sin t$, which happens only when
$t=0$. Likewise, when $x=2\pi$, $t-2\pi=\sin t$ and
$t=2\pi$. Alternately, because we understand how the cycloid is
produced, we can see directly that one arch is generated by 
$0\le t\le 2\pi$. In general, of course, the $t$ limits will be
different than the $x$ limits.

This technique will allow us to compute some quite interesting areas,
as illustrated by the exercises.

As a final example, we see how to compute the length of a curve given
by parametric equations. Section~\xrefn{sec:arc length} investigates
arc length for functions given as $y$ in terms of $x$, and develops
the formula for length:
$$\int_a^b \sqrt{1+\left({dy\over dx}\right)^2}\;dx.$$
Using some properties of derivatives, including the chain rule, we can
convert this to use parametric equations $x=f(t)$, $y=g(t)$:
$$\eqalign{
  \int_a^b \sqrt{1+\left({dy\over dx}\right)^2}\;dx&=
  \int_a^b \sqrt{\left({dx\over dt}\right)^2
  +\left({dx\over dt}\right)^2\left({dy\over dx}\right)^2}\;{dt\over dx}\;dx\cr
  &=\int_u^v \sqrt{\left({dx\over dt}\right)^2+
    \left({dy\over dt}\right)^2}\;dt\cr
  &=\int_u^v \sqrt{(f'(t))^2+(g'(t))^2}\;dt.\cr}
$$
Here $u$ and $v$ are the $t$ limits corresponding to the $x$ limits
$a$ and $b$.

\example Find the length of one arch of the cycloid.
From $x=t-\sin t$, $y=1-\cos t$, we get the derivatives
$f'=1-\cos t$ and $g'=\sin t$, so the length is 
$$
  \int_0^{2\pi} \sqrt{(1-\cos t)^2+\sin^2 t}\;dt=
  \int_0^{2\pi} \sqrt{2-2\cos t}\;dt.
$$
Now we use the formula $\ds \sin^2(t/2)=(1-\cos(t))/2$ or
$\ds 4\sin^2(t/2)=2-2\cos t$ to get
$$\int_0^{2\pi} \sqrt{4\sin^2(t/2)}\;dt.$$
Since $0\le t\le2\pi$, $\sin(t/2)\ge 0$, so we can rewrite this as
$$\int_0^{2\pi} 2\sin(t/2)\;dt = 8.$$

\exercise Recall the involute of a circle from
exercise~\xrefn{exer:involute of a circle} in
section~\xrefn{sec:parametric equations}. Instead of an infinite
string, suppose we have a string of length $\pi$ attached to the unit
circle at $(-1,0)$, and initially laid around the top of the circle
with its end at $(1,0)$. If we grasp the end of the string and begin
to unwind it, we get a piece of the involute, until the string is
vertical. If we then keep the string taut and continue to rotate it
counter-clockwise, the end traces out a semi-circle with center at
$(-1,0)$, until the string is vertical again. Continuing, the end of
the string traces out the mirror image of the initial portion of the
curve; see figure~\xrefn{fig:involute plus semicircle}. Find the area
